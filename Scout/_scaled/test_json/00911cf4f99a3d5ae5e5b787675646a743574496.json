However, the short read size, complex composition, and large data size can all make taxonomic analysis difficult. In particular, commonly used alignment-based methods are not ideal choices for detecting new viral species. In this work, we present a novel hierarchical classification model named CHEER, which can conduct read-level taxonomic classification from order to genus for new species. By combining k-mer embedding-based encoding, hierarchically organized CNNs, and carefully trained rejection layer, CHEER is able to assign correct taxonomic labels for reads from new species. We tested CHEER on both simulated and real sequencing data. The results show that CHEER can achieve higher accuracy than popular alignmentbased and alignment-free taxonomic assignment tools. The source code, scripts, and pre-trained parameters for CHEER are available via GitHub: https://github.com/KennthShang/CHEER.",

While bacteria are the main focus of most metagenomic sequencing projects, there are fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data with sequencing viruses as the main purpose [2] . There are different types of viruses. We are mainly concerned with RNA viruses because many RNA viruses are notorious human pathogens, such as Influenza A, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, SARS-CoV, and recently identified 2019-nCoV causing Wuhan pneumonia. Unlike DNA viruses, RNA viruses, which contain RNA genomes, lack faithful proofreading mechanisms during replication and thus can produce a group of related but different viral strains infecting the same host. This high genetic diversity within and across different hosts poses a great challenge for designing long-term protection strategies against these infectious diseases. For example, as the circulating strains can change every year, flu vaccine has to be administered every year.",

To detect known species with available reference genomes, alignment-based methods can provide sufficient information for both classification and abundance estimation. This function has been incorporated in existing pipelines [9, 10, 11] and is thus not the focus of our tool. Instead, our tool is designed to handle the challenging cases of assigning taxonomic labels for reads of new species, which have not been observed before. This problem was clearly formulated in metagenomic phylogenetic classification tools such as Phymm and PhymmBL [8] . We first define the classification problem following the formulation in Phymm: the classification problem is the assignment of a phylogenetic group label to each read in input data sets. As we are only interested in the hard case of classifying reads of new species, which have not been sequenced and thus no label exists for these species, the expected labels for these reads are the higher-rank taxonomic groups such as genus, family, or order. All our data and experiments are designed so that the test species are masked in the reference database and the trained models.",

Third, as viral metagenomic data usually contains contaminations from either the host genomes or other microbes, we formulated the pre-processing step as an open set problem in targeted image classification and rejected non-viral reads by choosing appropriate negative training sets.

In order to conduct phylogenetic classification for reads from new species, or even new genus, our classification is conducted using a top-down approach from the root to the leaf node. The top layer is a trained CNN that can reject reads not belonging to RNA viruses, which is an important preprocessing step for viral metagenomic data because of the contamination from the host genome or other microbes. Then, the filtered reads (i.e. mostly RNA viral reads) will be fed into the hierarchical classification model, which is referred to as the tree model hereafter. Specifically, the order-level classifier is responsible for classifying the reads into their originating orders. Then each order has a separately trained classifier for assigning input reads to families within that order (O1 to O3 in Fig. 1 ). For all the reads assigned into one family, the family classifier (F1-F7) will assign the reads to different genus within that family. As an example, a path for classifying a read from a species in genus 7 is highlighted in Fig. 1 . CHEER also implemented early stop functions at each level for stopping the classification path at higher ranks. This function can accommodate taxonomic classification for species from new genus or even higher ranks, which is possible for RNA viruses. It is convenient to add fine-grained classifiers within each genus so that we can assign species-level labels. However, as our focus is to conduct phylogenetic classification for reads from new species that do not have a species labels in the training data, we did not include the species-level assignment in this work.",

The convolution filters used in CNN resemble positionspecific weight matrix of motifs in genomic sequences. Frequently activated convolution filters can represent well-conserved motifs among sequences in the same class. Thus, a large number of convolution filters will be used in our CNN in order to learn well-conserved sequence features in different classes. Deep CNNs in fields such as computer vision often have multiple convolution layers in order to obtain more abstract features from training images. Here, we use a wide convolution design rather than a deep one, following the idea in [18] . Fig. 2 shows the classifier with the default hyper-parameters. First, reads will be encoded in matrices as input to the convolution layer using two methods. We will describe and compare these two encoding methods later in the Section 2.3. Then, multiple convolution filters of different sizes are utilized to learn the conserved sequence features. According to our empirical study, we choose 3, 7, 11, 15 as the filter sizes, with 256 filters for each size respectively (see Fig. 2 ). Max pooling is then applied to each convolution filter's output so that only the highest convolution value is kept. After the max-pooling layer, we have a 256-dimentional vector as the output of each convolution layer. We concatenate these four vectors into one 1024-dimentional vector and feed it to one fully connected layer with 512 hidden units. Dropout is applied to mitigate overfitting. The CrossEntropyLoss function supplied by Pytorch is adopted as an error estimation function. Due to the unbalanced size of each training class, we use the reciprocal of the proportion of each class as their error weight to help the model fairly learn from each class. And we utilize Adam optimizer with a 0.001 learning rate to update the parameters. The model is trained on HPCC with the 2080Ti GPU unit. ",

A neural network with one hidden layer is trained to map a word to an n-dimensional vector so that the words that usually occur together will be closer in the n-dimension space. For our DNA read classification task, k-mers are the words and the embedding layer will map proximate kmers into vectors of high similarity. The main hyper-parameter when training the skip-gram model is the size of the training context m, which defines the maximum context location at which the furthest k-mer is taken for training.

Thus, we allow our model to stop at a higher rank in the tree during the top-down classification. Towards this goal, we still apply SoftMax threshold in our early stop function, which stops reads from further classification by the child classifiers. This early stop function also serves as a quality control measure for preventing wrong classifications if the confidence is low. For example, when a read arrives, the model may be able to identify its order and family labels with high reliability but cannot decide which genus it belongs to. In this case, the model should only assign order and family label to this read rather than classifying it into a potentially wrong genus. To achieve this goal, SoftMax threshold is applied for every classifier in the tree. Only reads with a score higher than the threshold will be assigned to the child class.",

Because training deep learning classifiers required enough samples, we removed the orders with only one family, families with only one genus, and genera with less than 3 species from our dataset. Finally, there are 6 orders, 23 families, and 55 genera remained. The RefSeq genomes are available at the following URL:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/fi nd-data/virus. The information of the taxa can be found in [Supplementary file 1]. As CHEER conducts read-level taxonomic classification, the training is also conducted using reads. In order to train our model on each complete virus genome, we generated simulated reads by uniformly extracting substrings of 250 bp with 200bp overlaps. All these reads formed the training set so that the model can learn the features from the whole genome. The validation set, however, is generated by read simulation tool WgSim [31] with specified error rate so that we can have a better estimation of the model's performance on real sequencing data. Some existing deep learning tools for taxonomic classification, like [21, 23] , generate reads first, then randomly choose some of them as training set and others as testing set. This strategy cannot guarantee that the training and testing data sets have no overlaps from the same species. In order to test whether our model can learn the label of new species, we use test species masking in the training set. Specifically, we split our RNA virus database into two independent sets. For any test species, their reads are not used in the training data. Thus, the model will only use the knowledge of known species for the new species classification.",

The taxonomic classification of Zaire Ebolavirus in the tree model is highlighted in Fig. 7 . We chose one of the Ebola species named Zaire Ebolavirus as our testing species because it is the most dangerous of the five Ebolavirus species and was responsible for the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak. We downloaded the dataset from NCBI with accession number SRR1930021. These reads were sequenced by Illumina using whole-genome amplification strategy. Since Zaire Ebolavirus usually causes fatal hemorrhagic fever and abdominal pain, it is possible that this Ebola virus occurs with other gut bacteria. Thus, we created a mock viral metagenomic data by mixing these Ebola reads with a gut bacteria amplicon sequencing data in order to test whether CHEER can reject the bacterial reads at the top rejection layer. The gut bacteria dataset is downloaded from NCBI with accession number: SRR10714026. There are totally 2,737 Ebola virus reads and 51,280 gut bacterial reads in the mock data.

We followed VirusSeeker [10] , which is a BLASTx based model, to align translated reads to virus-only protein database (VIRUSDB NR) provided by NCBI. Then, we kept alignments with E-value cutoff 0.001, which is used in VirusSeeker. The output of BLASTx shows that a read can often align to multiple proteins, making the phylogenetic classification ambiguous (see Fig. 11 ). Also, existing tools such as VirusSeeker often use the best alignment only, which does not always yield the highest accuracy. To optimize the usage of the alignment-based method, we implemented k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm to record the best k alignments rather than only using the best one. The label of the input read is determined by the majority vote in the labels of the top k alignments. According to Fig. 10 , most of the reads have hit numbers between 11 to 15 and 6 to10. Thus, we chose 1, 5, 10, 15 as our k when running kNN. There are also 512 reads that cannot be aligned with any VIRUSDB protein sequence. All these reads will be regarded as wrong prediction. Fig. 11 shows the classification results of kNN. When we use the best hit as the prediction the accuracy is only 64%. The best performance of kNN will be 74% with 2,026 correct predictions when k is 5. But the accuracy sharply decreases if k is larger than 5. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 also revealed that it is hard for users to choose a proper k in real classification tasks. The most common value of the hit number is 11-15 shown in Fig. 11 . The best kNN result, however, has a k equal to 5. Thus, comparing to this alignment-based method, CHEER, with 2,407 (87.9%) reads classified correctly, is more practical and reliable.",

Because the genus of Ebolavirus exists in our classification tree, the evaluation of the early stop function focuses on the second purpose. Fig. 12 shows the percentage of how many reads are classified into Ebolavirus genus correctly for different classifiers. By allowing early stop, the number of wrong predictions decreased sharply. In short, although there are fewer reads being labelled at the genus level, the total number of reads with wrong classification is decreased. Thus, this is still a useful feature provided by CHEER.",

The training reads are extracted uniformly from the genome to make sure that classifiers can learn the features from the whole genome. To evaluate the model on new species detection, all species in the test set are excluded from the training data. Error rates are also added to evaluate the robustness of the model. The results reveal that the model is tolerant to the sequencing error. In addition, a SoftMax threshold rejection layer is applied to filter reads from non-RNA viruses. The SoftMax threshold in each classifier will also help early stop classification with low confidence and thus decreases the wrong predication rate. We show a case study on real-world data to identify how this threshold will influence the rejection classifier and early stop function. The results show that CHEER competes favorably with state-of-the-art tools.",
