Abstract 27 The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses comprise a single large open reading 28 frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 29 has an unusually large 5′ UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the 30 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting 31 replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5′ terminal 360 nucleotide 32 stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of 33 two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs 34 by selective 2′ hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and 35 determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. 36 SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK 37 structures for their function. Deletion experiments showed that although PKs are not essential 38 for replication, they provide genomes with a competitive advantage. However, although 39 replicons and full-length genomes lacking all PKs were replication competent, no infectious 40 virus was rescued from genomes containing less than one PK copy. This is consistent with our 41 earlier report describing the presence of putative packaging signals in the PK region. 42 43 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The P2 64 and P3 regions encode the non-structural proteins 2B and 2C and 3A, 3B (1-3) (VPg), 3C pro and 4 structural protein-coding region is replaced by reporter genes, allow the study of genome 68 replication without the requirement for high containment (9, 10) ( figure 1A ). The FMDV 5′ UTR is the largest known picornavirus UTR, comprising approximately 1300 71 nucleotides and containing several highly structured regions. The first 360 nucleotides at the 5′ 72 end are predicted to fold into a single large stem loop termed the S-fragment, followed by a The PKs were originally predicted in 1987 and consist of two to four tandem repeats of a ~48 86 nucleotide region containing a small stem loop and downstream interaction site (figure 1B) 87 (12). Due to the sequence similarity between the PKs (figure 1C), it is speculated that they 88 were formed by duplication events during viral replication, probably involving recombination. 89 Between two and four PKs are present in different virus isolates but no strain has been 90 identified with less than two PKs, emphasising their potential importance in the viral life cycle 91 (19, 20) .

Plasmid construction. 117 The FMDV replicon plasmids, pRep-ptGFP, and the replication-defective polymerase mutant 118 control, 3D-GNN, have already been described (10). To introduce mutations into the PK region, the pRep-ptGFP replicon plasmid was digested 121 with SpeI and KpnI and the resulting fragment inserted into a sub-cloning vector (pBluescript) 122 to create the pBluescript PK. PKs 3 and 4 were removed by digestion with HindIII and AatII 123 before insertion of a synthetic DNA sequence with PK 3 and 4 deleted. PKs 2, 3 and 4 were 124 deleted by PCR amplification using ΔPK 234 Forward primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse 125 primer, the resultant product was digested with HindIII and AatII and ligated into the 126 pBluescript PK vector. Complete PK deletion was achieved by introduction of an AflII site at 127 the 3′ end of the poly-C tract by PCR mutagenesis to create the sub-cloning vector, pBluescript 128 C11, which was then used to remove all the PKs by PCR mutagenesis using ΔPK 1234 forward 129 primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse primer. The modified PK sequences were removed from 130 the sub-cloning vectors and inserted into the pRep-ptGFP plasmid using NheI-HF and KpnI-131 HF. 132 133 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Mutations were then introduced into the replicon plasmid as described above. To assess the effects of truncation of the poly-C-tract on replication the entire sequence was 137 removed. This was performed by PCR mutagenesis using primers C0 SpeI, and FMDV 1331- In vitro transcription. 143 In vitro transcription reactions for replicon assays were performed as described previously (28). Transcription reactions to produce large amounts of RNA for SHAPE analysis were performed 145 with purified linear DNA as described above, and 1 μg of linearised DNA was then used in a 146 HiScribe T7 synthesis kit (NEB), before DNase treatment and purification using a PureLink FastQ files were quality checked using FastQC with poor quality reads filtered using the 225 Sickle algorithm. Host cell reads were removed using FastQ Screen algorithm and FMDV 226 reads assembled de novo into contigs using IDBA-UD (35).

As near wt level of 353 replication was observed when only one PK was present, all further mutagenesis was 354 performed in a C11 replicon plasmid containing only PK 1. In addition, the orientation of PK 1 was reversed by \"flipping\" the nucleotide sequence to 367 potentially facilitate hybridisation of the loop with upstream rather than downstream sequences. Changing the orientation of the PK reduced replicon replication to a similar level seen in the replication decreased until at passage three there is a 2.5 fold reduction compared to that of 398 author/funder.

The 5′ UTR of FMDV is unique amongst picornaviruses due to its large size and the presence 454 of multiple RNA elements, some of which still have unknown function. One of these features 455 is a series of repeated PKs varying in number from 2-4, depending on virus strain. In this study, 456 we sequentially deleted or mutated the PKs to help understand their role in the viral life cycle. 457 We also confirmed the predicted PK structures by SHAPE mapping, although there may be Although all viruses isolated to date contain at least two PKs, replicons or viruses containing a 464 single PK were still replication competent. However, replicons with more than a single PK 465 were found to have a competitive advantage over replicons with a single PK when sequentially 466 passaged. Replicons lacking all PKs displayed poor passaging potential even when co-467 transfected with yeast tRNA, reinforcing the observation of a significant impact in replication. Moreover, viruses recovered from genomes with reduced numbers of PKs were slower growing 469 and produced smaller plaques. In addition, these differences were more pronounced in more PKs is functionally competent as no differences was seen between replicons congaing a single 472 author/funder. All rights reserved.

This observation is consistent with a previous report of deletion of PK1, 473 along with the Poly-C-tract, with no adverse effect in viral replication (37). This also supports 474 our findings that the truncation of the Poly-C-tract to create the C11 construct had no effect on 475 replicon replication in the cell lines tested. As has been described with Mengo virus, it is 476 possible that the role of the poly-C-tract is essential in other aspects of the viral lifecycle which 477 cannot be recapitulated in a standard tissue culture system (39). The presence of at least two PKs in all viral isolates sequenced so far suggests that multiple 480 PKs confer a competitive advantage in replication. Here we showed by sequential passage that 481 replicons containing at least two PKs were maintained at a level similar to wt, but replicons 482 containing only one PK showed a persistent decline. It is unclear why some viral isolates 483 contain two, three or four PKs is still unknown, but this may be stochastic variation or may 484 reflect subtle effects of host range or geographical localisation.

A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published, in scientific journals as well as through non-peer reviewed channels, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination. We examined all full genome sequences currently available to assess the presence of sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies. Our analysis clearly shows severe limitations in the present data, in light of which any finding should be considered, at the very best, preliminary and hypothesis-generating.

Common symptoms of infection include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, while severe cases are characterized by advanced respiratory distress and pneumonia, often resulting in death 2 . Soon after the first epidemiological data together with SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences were made available, a glut of phylogeny-based analyses began to circulate discussing, in scientific papers as well as (social) media, countries that might have been fueling the spread. The implications of misunderstanding the real dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic are extremely dangerous. Ethnic or social discrimination resulting from unsupported assumptions on viral contagion -often amplified by irresponsible, uncontrollable communications -can be highly damaging for people and countries. Despite (social) media are often vehicle for fake news and boast news hype, it is also worth noting the tremendous effort of the scientific community to provide free, up-to-date information on ongoing studies, as well as critical evaluations. In particular, the US-based NextStrain 3 team has been posting real-time updates on the epidemic tracing by molecular analyses. Several discussions and evidence-based debates on controversial hypotheses on the epidemic have ensued -such as the number of untraced infections in the US, the putative virus introduction in Italy through Germany, and the alleged lineage diversification in China 4 later criticized 5 -aided by a concerted and productive effort of internationally-renowned research groups in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Oxford, UK, among others. Recently, an editorial published on Science 6 has also highlighted how unsupported or misleading claims circulating in forums, social media, and even peer-reviewed articles, have been led by a substantial over interpretation of the available data. Hence, the urgency to reframe the current debate in more rigorous scientific terms, and quantitatively evaluate whether sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies currently exists, or which gaps need to be addressed. .

We downloaded all SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences deposited on GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) 8 to compare the number of high quality genomes sampled per country with the number of confirmed cases at the time of sampling, as well as the country's total population ( Figure 1 ). As March 10 th 2020, 331 genome sequences from 29 countries were available, almost twice as much than just one week earlier (March 3 rd 2020, 169 genome sequences from 22 countries). Yet, the sampling per country was inhomogeneous, with confirmed cases clearly uncorrelated to the number of genomes (Spearman correlation = 0.03). Moreover, correlation could only be investigated with confirmed cases (as proxy), since not all affected countries have made publicly available the total number of coronavirus testing performed. Even within the same country, sequenced genomes were usually sampled from few hotspots, not necessarily representative of the whole epidemic in that country. Italy, for example, the second country per confirmed cases, has uploaded so far only two genomes from Lombardy and three from Lazio (Table S1) , i.e. only two of the twenty Italian regions, all with confirmed cases 9 . China and USA contributed with 123 and 63 genomes respectively (56% combined), while 13 countries contribute with only one or two samples (6.3% combined). Notably, three countries with less than 400 confirmed cases have provided a substantial number of genomes (Netherlands 28, Australia 18, Singapore 11; 17% combined) ( Figure 1 ). The effect of inhomogeneous sampling and missing data on phylogeography reconstructions, like the ones recently rushed through news and (social) media to claim specific dissemination routes of SARS-CoV-2 among countries, can be quite dramatic. An instructive example is the putative introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy from Germany. The maximum likelihood (ML) tree, inferred from the full genome viral sequences available on March 3 rd , 2020 (Supplementary Figure S1 ), showed a well-supported cluster of European and Asian sequences (reported in Figure 2a ), which contained a subclade (subclade A, Figure 2a ) including a sequence isolated in Germany that .

Based on this observation (which was available on NextStrain), a heated discussion circulated on social media about a transmission event from Germany to Italy followed by further spread from Italy the other countries. However, in a new tree inferred just one week later, when more than 135 new full genome sequences were made available on GISAID 8 ( Figure S2 ), the direct link between Germany and Italy has disappeared due to the additional clustering of previously unsampled sequences from Portugal, Brazil, Wales and Netherland ( Figure 2b ). Most importantly, there is no sufficient evidence of a higher likelihood (Shimodaira-Hasgawa test, Table 1 ) for tree topologies generated arbitrarily switching branches in the tree (see arrows in Figure 2b) compared to the ML tree inferred from the real data. In other words, it is not possible with the present data to decide which branching pattern (and, therefore, phylogeographic reconstruction) is the most likely. Lack of resolution and uncertainty in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree is to be expected, considering that relatively little genetic diversity can be accumulated during the first three months of an epidemic, even for an exponentially spreading and fast-evolving RNA virus. Plots of pairwise transitions/transversions vs. genetic distance 10 showed, indeed, low genetic diversity among SARS-CoV-2 genomes, considerable scattering, and overlap in transitions and transversions among closely related sequences (Figure 3a ). The 331 full genomes available contained 477 out of 29,564 variable sites (1.6%), of which 377 were singleton and only 100 (0.34%) parsimony informative, indicating a substantial lack of phylogenetic information, and raising the possibility of a number of sequencing errors. Further assessment of phylogenetic signal in the dataset was carried out using likelihood mapping analysis 11 , which estimates the likelihood of each of possible tree topology for any group of four sequences (quartet), randomly .

Quartets are considered \"resolved\" when the three likelihoods are significantly different (phylogenetic signal, most dots equally distributed in the corners, i.e. data are suitable for robust phylogeny inference), unresolved or partially resolved, when all three likelihood values or two of them are not significantly different (phylogenetic noise, most dots in sides or center areas, i.e. data may not be sufficient for robust phylogeny inference). Extensive simulation studies have shown that, for sequences to be considered robust in terms of phylogenetic signal, side/center areas of the likelihood mapping must include <40% of the unresolved quartets 12 , way lower than the 52.9% unresolved quartets detected in the SARS-CoV-2 full genomes alignment ( Figure 3b ). It is important to keep in mind that such a lack of phylogenetic signal makes the overall topology of any SARS-CoV-2 tree unreliable, and even clades with high bootstrap values should be interpreted with extreme caution. Finally, the mean genetic distance of each sequence from the root of a ML tree indicated that the available genomic data lack temporal signal (no significant linear correlation between accumulated genetic distance and sampling time, Figure 3c ). This is, again, expected in genomes obtained over a very short period of time (~ three months) since the beginning of the outbreak. Bayesian analysis 13 , which infers phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns from a posterior distribution of trees, might facilitate comparisons about different evolutionary scenarios, help in retrieving the correct topology, and estimate an accurate evolutionary rate. With more genome sequences sampled from different time points and geographic areas made available, literally, every day, Bayesian analysis may soon be a viable option. However, as long the new data do not increase phylogenetic and temporal signal, Bayesian phylogenetic and phylogeography results would remain equally questionable. Taken together, our observations suggest that any conclusion drawn, at present, about existing lineages and direction of viral spread, based on phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data, is potentially misleading. Nowadays, published scientific data and media are very easily .

We believe that current molecular epidemiology data are not solid enough to provide a scientifically sound analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spread. Any inference based on phylogenetic trees should be considered at the very best preliminary, and hypothesis-generating. Hence the need for 1) avoiding stigmatization based on partial information and 2) continuing the concerted scientific effort to increase the number and quality of available data. The evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread will unveil an unprecedented amount of information, which is essential to make policy decisions. The whole of humanity is threatened by the current pandemic, and policy makers need to adjust their mitigation measures while the pandemic itself is developing. Some of the urgent answers required lie in the timely availability of abundant, high quality sequence data not only from countries experiencing a high number of reported cases, such as Italy and South Korea, but also from others that seem to be experiencing, at least for now, a lower number of infections. GISAID was accessed on March 3 rd and 10 th , 2020 (final dataset information reported in Table   S1 ). After quality control of sequences that were not full genomes or contained extensive stretches of unknown nucleotides, the first dataset (March 3 rd 2020) consisted of 169 genomes from 22 countries, while the second (March 10 th , 2020) 331 from 29 countries. Confirmed cases were retrieved for the same day from interactive web-based dashboard developed by Johns Hopkins University 14 . Transition/transversions vs. genetic distance plot were calculated using DAMBE6 10 . Evaluation of the presence of phylogenetic signal satisfying resolved phylogenetic relationships among sequences was carried out with IQ-TREE, allowing the software to search for all possible quartets .

Topology was tested performing the Shimodaira-Hasegawa 17 on \"Subclade A\" by comparing the inferred tree to three trees where two branches: (Tree 1) Italy (EPI_ISL_412973) switched with Wales (EPI_ISL_413555), (Tree 2) Germany (EPI_ISL_406862 with) Brazil (EPI_ISL_412964), (Tree 3) and Portugal (EPI_ISL_413648) with Brazil (EPI_ISL_412964), (Tree 4) Germany (EPI_ISL_406862) with Portugal (EPI_ISL_413648). All tests performed 10,000 resamplings using the using the RELL approximation method 18 . Position of these genomes within \"Subclade A\" is indicated in Figure 1 with an arrow. Exploration of temporal structure, i.e. presence of molecular clock in the data, was assessed by regression of divergence -root-to-tip genetic distance-against sampling time using TempEst 19 . In this case, absence of a linear trend indicates that the data does not contain temporal signal and that the data is not appropriate for phylogenetic inference using molecular clock models. Ancestral state reconstruction of full datasets reported in Figures S1 and S2 were based on the ML tree obtained with IQ-TREE and performed using TreeTime 20 . We choose to show the \"European subclade\" and \"Subclade A\" as cladograms in Figure 1 as there are no phylogenetic and temporal signals in the datasets: scaling phylogenies in time or nucleotide substitution in this case is misleading. .

The mass quarantine measure implemented in the epidemic's epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on January 23, 2020, has stopped the human migration between Wuhan and other places. However, according to the local authorities, over five million people had already traveled from Wuhan to other parts of China in the weeks leading to January 23, 2020, with the majority (79.96%) to the other cities within Hubei. Healthcare resources have become a major bottleneck in the response to this public health crisis. The sudden onset of the epidemic and the sheer size of the infection have caused significant shortage in healthcare resources across Hubei Province. So far, there have been over 11,000 non-local healthcare professionals, mobilized by the public health authorities from other parts of China, fighting against the epidemic in Wuhan. However, this is far from adequate for Wuhan given the severity of the epidemic. In addition to Wuhan, other cities in Hubei are in need of urgent external help as well with respect to health resources, as multiple localized outbreaks are taking place. On February 7, 2020, the National Health Commission of China (NHCC) initiated the \"One City Covered by One Province\" program, explicitly assigning a specific province to aid one city in Hubei. Two critical questions of operational nature remain, which cities, both in Hubei and other provinces, are most vulnerable to localized outbreaks, and how the public health authorities should balance the healthcare resources under stress to best fight the epidemic and minimize the risks? This study is aimed to shed light on these questions by developing a vulnerability analysis framework integrating the human movement and healthcare resource data. This study makes use of four public datasets: (a) the daily counts of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, collected from NHCC 4 ; (b) the list of designated hospitals with the number of reserved beds, retrieved from the websites of the provincial and municipal health commissions; (c) the information of the hospitals designated for 2019-nCoV, retrieved from 99.com.cn, a public hospital database; and (d) the human movement data, provided by the Baidu Migration (http://qianxi.baidu.com/), a public site offering real-time migration information across mainland China. Recent studies indicated that the confirmed case data for Hubei Province, in particular, Wuhan, was subject to the under-reporting bias, while the data from places outside of Hubei is more reliable for inferring the actual epidemic size 5 . Following Wu et al. 5 , we developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR)-based metapopulation model, which has 100 sub-populations representing the 100 cities that have the greatest number of people traveling from Wuhan. Note that we adopted the same epidemiological parameters as Wu et al. 5 . This model was then used to estimate IDi, the number of infected individuals in each city. Lastly, healthcare-resource-adjusted vulnerability indexes to the 2019-nCoV outbreak for city i, Vi were obtained as follows: Vi = IDi / Bi, where Bi represents the total number of reserved beds in the designated hospitals. The Figure presents the estimated number of infected individuals, as well as the healthcareresource-adjusted vulnerability to the 2019-nCoV outbreak across mainland China, as of January 29, 2020. The epidemiological parameters may have changed after January 23, 2020, when the lockdown measure was implemented. Thus, we only use the data by January 23, 2020 and produce the estimation till January 29, 2020 to accommodate the six-day incubation period identified by Wu et al. 5 . The ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities are also listed in the figure. Note that the cities in Hubei (which are being aided by other provinces) are not presented here because of their significantly higher vulnerability as compared to others. Among the ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities, Changsha, Beijing, Chongqing and Shanghai are major metropolises with a large number of estimated infected individuals. Xinyang, Jiujiang, Nanchang and Yiyang are medium-sized cities neighboring Hubei. In particular, Xinyang appears to be in a particular vulnerable situation because of the large number of people traveling from Wuhan and its insufficient healthcare resources. The reported vulnerability analysis informs public health response to the 2019-nCoV epidemic in multiple ways. For the identified cities with high vulnerability, it is important to increase the reserve of healthcare resources or have contingent plans. In particular, some of these cities already contributed significant healthcare resources to Hubei, leaving themselves inadequately prepared for the localized outbreak. Our analysis revealed that several medium-sized cities, particularly those neighboring Hubei, are highly vulnerable due to the lack of healthcare resources.

However, the short read size, complex composition, and large data size can all make taxonomic analysis difficult. In particular, commonly used alignment-based methods are not ideal choices for detecting new viral species. In this work, we present a novel hierarchical classification model named CHEER, which can conduct read-level taxonomic classification from order to genus for new species. By combining k-mer embedding-based encoding, hierarchically organized CNNs, and carefully trained rejection layer, CHEER is able to assign correct taxonomic labels for reads from new species. We tested CHEER on both simulated and real sequencing data. The results show that CHEER can achieve higher accuracy than popular alignmentbased and alignment-free taxonomic assignment tools.

While bacteria are the main focus of most metagenomic sequencing projects, there are fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data with sequencing viruses as the main purpose [2] . There are different types of viruses. We are mainly concerned with RNA viruses because many RNA viruses are notorious human pathogens, such as Influenza A, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, SARS-CoV, and recently identified 2019-nCoV causing Wuhan pneumonia. Unlike DNA viruses, RNA viruses, which contain RNA genomes, lack faithful proofreading mechanisms during replication and thus can produce a group of related but different viral strains infecting the same host. This high genetic diversity within and across different hosts poses a great challenge for designing long-term protection strategies against these infectious diseases. For example, as the circulating strains can change every year, flu vaccine has to be administered every year. Advances in viral metagenomics have contributed significantly to new RNA virus discovery. According to a survey by Woolhouse et. al, the number of newly identified RNA viruses is changing from 1,899 in 2005 to 5,561 in 2018, which is 3 times of increase [3] . Largescale RNA virus sequencing projects using nextgeneration sequencing technologies have been conducted for different species. For example, Shi et al. have discovered a large number of new RNA viruses by sequencing samples from invertebrate and vertebrate animals [4, 5] . Claire et al. have discovered 25 new RNA viruses by sequencing samples associated with different drosophilid [6] . Bolduc et al. sequenced RNA viruses from Archaeal and bacterial samples [7] . Given fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data and expected discovery of new viruses, a key step is to conduct composition analysis for these data and assign taxonomic groups for possibly new species. Composition analysis can be conducted at the read level or contig level. There is no doubt that contigs can provide more information than short reads in taxonomic classification. However, metagenomic assembly is still one of the most challenging computational problems in bioinformatics. Unlike single genome assembly, metagenomic assembly is more likely to produce chimeric contigs that can contain regions from different species. Thus, metagenomic assembly is often preceded by read binning that groups reads with the same or similar taxonomic labels [8] in order to achieve better performance. In this work, we design a read level taxonomic classification tool (named as \"CHEER\") for labeling new species in viral metagenomic data. To detect known species with available reference genomes, alignment-based methods can provide sufficient information for both classification and abundance estimation. This function has been incorporated in existing pipelines [9, 10, 11] and is thus not the focus of our tool. Instead, our tool is designed to handle the challenging cases of assigning taxonomic labels for reads of new species, which have not been observed before. This problem was clearly formulated in metagenomic phylogenetic classification tools such as Phymm and PhymmBL [8] . We first define the classification problem following the formulation in Phymm: the classification problem is the assignment of a phylogenetic group label to each read in input data sets. As we are only interested in the hard case of classifying reads of new species, which have not been sequenced and thus no label exists for these species, the expected labels for these reads are the higher-rank taxonomic groups such as genus, family, or order. All our data and experiments are designed so that the test species are masked in the reference database and the trained models. Previous experiments have shown that nucleotide-level homology search is not sensitive enough for assigning higher rank taxonomic groups to reads from new species [9, 10] . Protein-based homology search is thus preferred for phylogenetic classification [11, 12] . In particular, a recent tool, VirusSeeker [13] utilized BLASTx to classify reads into bacteria, phages, and other viruses. It is not clear whether the protein homology search is able to generate accurate classification at lower ranks. We will evaluate this in our experiments. There are also alignment-free methods for phylogenetic classification. Many of those tools implemented different machine learning models and were mainly designed for bacteria. For example, RDP [14] adopted a Naïve Bayes based classifier that can automatically learn features from the reads and assigned taxonomic labels to sequences from bacterial and archaeal 16S genes and fungal 28S genes. The NBC classifier [15, 16] encoded metagenomic reads using k-mers and implemented a bag-of-word model to achieve the readlevel taxonomic classification. Phymm [8] utilized interpolated Markov models (IMMs) for metagenomic read classification. These learning-based models enable users to label reads originating from new species. The previous works have shown that sequence composition is still an important and informative feature for phylogenetic classification. Recent applications of deep learning models have achieved better performance than conventional machine learning methods in different sequence classification problems [17] . In particular, the convolution filters in Convolutional Neural Network models (CNN) can represent degenerated sequence motifs and thus help CNN models to learn abstract composition-based features. For example, frequently activated convolution filters learned by DeepFam often represented the conserved motifs in different protein domain families [18] . The successful applications of deep learning in sequence classification motivated us to design a novel deep learning-based classification model for assigning taxonomic groups for new species in viral metagenomic data. Our main contributions are summarized below. First, our deep learning model can assign higher rank phylogenetic group labels (such as genus) for reads from new species. To achieve this goal, our model organizes multiple CNN-based classifiers in a tree for hierarchical taxonomic group assignment. Second, to enable our model to capture as much information as possible from short reads, we implemented and compared two encoding methods: one hot vs. embedding. Third, as viral metagenomic data usually contains contaminations from either the host genomes or other microbes, we formulated the pre-processing step as an open set problem in targeted image classification and rejected non-viral reads by choosing appropriate negative training sets. We tested our model on both simulated metagenomic data and also real sequencing data. The results show that our model competes favorably with other popular methods. In this section, we will introduce our method for viral metagenomic taxonomic classification. First, we will show the architecture of CHEER, which is a hierarchical classification model from order to genus. Second, classifiers at each level will be described. Third, we will introduce DNA sequence encoding using skipgram based word embedding and compare it with onehot encoding. Forth, we will describe the rejection layer, following the idea of the open set problem, which is adopted to filter reads not belonging to RNA viruses. Finally, we will detail our dataset used in training and validation. The architecture of our model is sketched in Fig. 1. The key component is a tree model that consists of multiple classifiers from order to genus. In order to conduct phylogenetic classification for reads from new species, or even new genus, our classification is conducted using a top-down approach from the root to the leaf node. The top layer is a trained CNN that can reject reads not belonging to RNA viruses, which is an important preprocessing step for viral metagenomic data because of the contamination from the host genome or other microbes. Then, the filtered reads (i.e. mostly RNA viral reads) will be fed into the hierarchical classification model, which is referred to as the tree model hereafter. Specifically, the order-level classifier is responsible for classifying the reads into their originating orders. Then each order has a separately trained classifier for assigning input reads to families within that order (O1 to O3 in Fig. 1 ). For all the reads assigned into one family, the family classifier (F1-F7) will assign the reads to different genus within that family. As an example, a path for classifying a read from a species in genus 7 is highlighted in Fig. 1 . CHEER also implemented early stop functions at each level for stopping the classification path at higher ranks. This function can accommodate taxonomic classification for species from new genus or even higher ranks, which is possible for RNA viruses. It is convenient to add fine-grained classifiers within each genus so that we can assign species-level labels. However, as our focus is to conduct phylogenetic classification for reads from new species that do not have a species labels in the training data, we did not include the species-level assignment in this work. Alternative designs of hierarchical classification work, like [19, 20] , either build a classifier for each taxonomic rank or build a binary classifier for each class. We implemented a structure that built just one classifier for each taxonomic rank and compared different structures' performance. According to the result shown in [Supplementary file 1], the structure shown in Fig.1 is better than one classifier per rank. Although one classifier per rank requires fewer classifiers, it needs to train many more parameters because the number of labels for each classifier increases by times. As a result, we observe overfitting more frequently. Each classifier in the tree model is implemented using CNN, which has achieved superior performance in various sequence classification problems [18] . The convolution filters used in CNN resemble positionspecific weight matrix of motifs in genomic sequences. Frequently activated convolution filters can represent well-conserved motifs among sequences in the same class. Thus, a large number of convolution filters will be used in our CNN in order to learn well-conserved sequence features in different classes. Deep CNNs in fields such as computer vision often have multiple convolution layers in order to obtain more abstract features from training images. Here, we use a wide convolution design rather than a deep one, following the idea in [18] . Fig. 2 shows the classifier with the default hyper-parameters. First, reads will be encoded in matrices as input to the convolution layer using two methods. We will describe and compare these two encoding methods later in the Section 2.3. Then, multiple convolution filters of different sizes are utilized to learn the conserved sequence features. According to our empirical study, we choose 3, 7, 11, 15 as the filter sizes, with 256 filters for each size respectively (see Fig. 2 ). Max pooling is then applied to each convolution filter's output so that only the highest convolution value is kept. After the max-pooling layer, we have a 256-dimentional vector as the output of each convolution layer. We concatenate these four vectors into one 1024-dimentional vector and feed it to one fully connected layer with 512 hidden units. Dropout is applied to mitigate overfitting. The CrossEntropyLoss function supplied by Pytorch is adopted as an error estimation function. Due to the unbalanced size of each training class, we use the reciprocal of the proportion of each class as their error weight to help the model fairly learn from each class. And we utilize Adam optimizer with a 0.001 learning rate to update the parameters. The model is trained on HPCC with the 2080Ti GPU unit.  In previous deep learning-based sequence classification models [21, 22] , one hot encoding was commonly adopted to convert a sequence into a matrix, which will then be used as input to convolution layers. There also exist some methods using k-mer composition [23] and frequency [15, 16] to encode the DNA sequence, similar to the bag-of-words model in the field of natural language processing. However, these k-mers representation cannot give complete sequential information about the original reads. To incorporate both the k-mer composition and also their ordering information, we build a Skip-Gram [24] based embedding layer that can learn which k-mers tend to occur close to each other. Embedding is widely used in natural language processing to learn the semantic and syntactic relationships from sentences. A neural network with one hidden layer is trained to map a word to an n-dimensional vector so that the words that usually occur together will be closer in the n-dimension space. For our DNA read classification task, k-mers are the words and the embedding layer will map proximate kmers into vectors of high similarity. The main hyper-parameter when training the skip-gram model is the size of the training context m, which defines the maximum context location at which the furthest k-mer is taken for training. Specifically, for a kmer at position i as the input to the skip-gram model, the output k-mers are its neighbors located at i+jk, where −m ≤ ≤ m. Larger m results in more training samples with a cost of training time. In our model, the default value of m is 1. As shown in Fig. 3 , we will sample 3 k-mers as our dataset at a time with the middle one as the input and the surrounding two as the output. As proven in [24] , Skip-Gram is able to automatically learn the relationship between proximate words and thus is expected to help learn the order between k-mers in genomic data. We implemented a hidden layer with 100 hidden units shown in Fig. 3 . After training the model, the co-occurrence features are embedded in the output of the hidden layer. Thus, a k-mer in a read will be represented as a 100-dimension vector, where each element in the vector is the output of the hidden unit in the hidden layer. When we use this pre-trained embedding layer to encode the reads, we first split each read into sequential k-mers. Second, each k-mer is fed to the embedding layer and the output is a 100-dimension vector. Third, all these vectors are combined into a large matrix according to the original position of each k-mers. Finally, this matrix will be fed to the convolutional layer. Based on our large-scale experiments, we found that classifiers are easy to overfit with increase of k. Thus, we choose 100-dimensional feature vectors with k being 3 as our default embedding layer parameter set based on our empirical analysis. Due to the small genome size and limitations in library construction, it is not rare that many viral metagenomic datasets are still contaminated with the genomes of the host and other microbes. Viral read screening is thus a key pre-processing step before the downstream composition analysis. Specifically, our tree model should only be applied to viral reads. However, the close set nature of the classifier forces it to assign a known label to each input without being able to distinguish viral reads from others. In this work, we will reject non-viral reads by formulating it as an open set problem in targeted image classification [25] . In a majority of neural network models [26, 27] , the logit of the last layer will be fed into the SoftMax function, which takes a vector of n real numbers as input and output a normalized probability vector for all labels/classes. However, for an irrelevant input from an unknown clade, all classes in the model tend to have low probabilities and thus applying a threshold on uncertainty can be used to reject unknown classes [25] . Along with this idea, serval approaches [28, 29] have been proposed to solve the open set problem. In this work, we incorporate the pre-processing step in our hierarchical classification model by integrating a trained CNN and a SoftMax threshold. Contaminations such as bacteria will be rejected using empirically chosen SoftMax threshold τ. Our experiments show that SoftMax outputs a nearly uniform probability distribution of all labels if the input is not relevant. Thus, the SoftMax threshold τ is used to reject reads not belonging to either DNA or RNA viruses. However, using this thresholding method is not able to distinguish DNA viral reads from RNA viral reads due to their similar sequence composition. To accommodate this challenge, we designed a rejection classifier in the top layer using DNA viral reads as the negative class in the training (see Fig. 1 ). As the focus of our work is to assign labels for new species, the hierarchical classification ends at genuslevel assignment, which is conducted by the bottom layer in Fig. 1 . Given the fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data, there are cases where a new species does not belong to any existing genus and thus the label assignment should stop at the higher ranks. Thus, we allow our model to stop at a higher rank in the tree during the top-down classification. Towards this goal, we still apply SoftMax threshold in our early stop function, which stops reads from further classification by the child classifiers. This early stop function also serves as a quality control measure for preventing wrong classifications if the confidence is low. For example, when a read arrives, the model may be able to identify its order and family labels with high reliability but cannot decide which genus it belongs to. In this case, the model should only assign order and family label to this read rather than classifying it into a potentially wrong genus. To achieve this goal, SoftMax threshold is applied for every classifier in the tree. Only reads with a score higher than the threshold will be assigned to the child class. An example of early stop is highlighted by the yellow path in Fig. 1 . The model can classify the read into order 2 (O2) and then family 4 (F4) with high reliability but cannot decide which genus it belongs to. All the viruses used in the experiments were obtained from the RefSeq in the NCBI virus database. The The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.009001 doi: bioRxiv preprint viruses' taxonomic classification was downloaded from Virus Taxonomy 2018b Release [30] published by the International Committee on Taxonomic of Virus (ICVT). Because training deep learning classifiers required enough samples, we removed the orders with only one family, families with only one genus, and genera with less than 3 species from our dataset. Finally, there are 6 orders, 23 families, and 55 genera remained. The RefSeq genomes are available at the following URL:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/fi nd-data/virus. The information of the taxa can be found in [Supplementary file 1]. As CHEER conducts read-level taxonomic classification, the training is also conducted using reads. In order to train our model on each complete virus genome, we generated simulated reads by uniformly extracting substrings of 250 bp with 200bp overlaps. All these reads formed the training set so that the model can learn the features from the whole genome. The validation set, however, is generated by read simulation tool WgSim [31] with specified error rate so that we can have a better estimation of the model's performance on real sequencing data. Some existing deep learning tools for taxonomic classification, like [21, 23] , generate reads first, then randomly choose some of them as training set and others as testing set. This strategy cannot guarantee that the training and testing data sets have no overlaps from the same species. In order to test whether our model can learn the label of new species, we use test species masking in the training set. Specifically, we split our RNA virus database into two independent sets. For any test species, their reads are not used in the training data. Thus, the model will only use the knowledge of known species for the new species classification. In this section, we will first give details of the hyperparameters of CHEER. Then we present the results of applying CHEER to both simulated and mock sequencing data. For the simulated data by WgSim, we evaluated how sequencing error rate affects the performance of CHEER and compared the taxonomic classification results with state-of-the-art. For the mock data, we tested CHEER's performance in both taxonomic classification and its ability in distinguishing viral reads from others. In our experiments, the minimum number of species within a genus is 3. We thus constructed three test sets, each containing reads from one species that is randomly chosen from each genus. The three test sets contain three different species, respectively. In total, 165 species from 55 genera are chosen to be \"new\" species for testing and the information of these species can be found in [Supplementary file 1]. We used WgSim to simulate reads from testing species. In order to evaluate the impact of sequencing error on CHEER, we simulated reads with an error rate of 0, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05, respectively. For each classifier (CNN), we computed the classification accuracy, which is defined in equation (1). To ensure that the computation of the accuracy is not affected by the number of reads from different species, we constructed a balanced test read set by simulating the same number of reads for each test species (1,000 reads for each). (1) For each component classifier in the tree model, we record the average accuracy for multiple test species. For each taxa level, we calculate the average accuracy of all the classifiers in the same level. We present the results of CHEER at each level in this section. Because CHEER is designed for new species, we benchmark it against alignment-free models. Based on the results shown by Wood et al. [7] , Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC) outperformed other alignment-free models. Thus, we compared the performance of CHEER and NBC. NBC in [14] was designed for bacteria taxonomic classification and thus, we retrained NBC on our RNA virus dataset. We implemented the NBC model following [14] with the same parameters. Since each family has a separately trained classifier, which conducts genus classification within that family, there are totally 14 classifiers at this level. Fig. 5 shows the accuracy for labeling families. There are totally 6 classifiers that assign reads to families within each of the 6 orders. Fig. 6 shows the mean accuracy at each rank. The family and genus level accuracy are the average accuracy of all classifiers in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 . There is only one classifier for order level classification. As shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 , CHEER has better performance than NBC across different ranks. We also compared the performance of using one-hot encoding and embedding layer in CHEER. The performance comparison at each rank shows that for most of the classifiers, the embedding layer improves the learning ability. Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 also revealed the robustness of CHEER. Although the classification accuracy decreases as the error rate increases, the decrease is smaller than 2%. The accuracy is almost identical for many classifiers. Thus, CHEER is not very sensitive to sequencing errors. We also conducted experiments for reads with higher error rates (0.02 and 0.05). The results can be found in [Supplementary file 1]. The next experiment is to evaluate our model on a real sequencing dataset and test CHEER's performance in both taxonomic classification and non-viral read rejection. We built a mock dataset by mixing Ebolavirus reads with gut bacterial reads from a gut amplicon sequencing dataset, which is chosen to ensure that we only use reads from bacteria. The taxonomic classification of Zaire Ebolavirus in the tree model is highlighted in Fig. 7 . We chose one of the Ebola species named Zaire Ebolavirus as our testing species because it is the most dangerous of the five Ebolavirus species and was responsible for the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak. We downloaded the dataset from NCBI with accession number SRR1930021. These reads were sequenced by Illumina using whole-genome amplification strategy. Since Zaire Ebolavirus usually causes fatal hemorrhagic fever and abdominal pain, it is possible that this Ebola virus occurs with other gut bacteria. Thus, we created a mock viral metagenomic data by mixing these Ebola reads with a gut bacteria amplicon sequencing data in order to test whether CHEER can reject the bacterial reads at the top rejection layer. The gut bacteria dataset is downloaded from NCBI with accession number: SRR10714026. There are totally 2,737 Ebola virus reads and 51,280 gut bacterial reads in the mock data. After the rejection layer, the Ebola reads will be used to evaluate our tree model. To treat Zaire Ebolavirus as a \"new\" species, we removed its genome from our training set and re-trained the whole pipeline. As shown in Fig. 7 , after removing this species, we still have four Ebola species in our training set. However, our read mapping experiment using Bowtie2 [32] showed that none of the reads from Zaire Ebolavirus can be mapped to other Ebola species with the default parameters, indicating that using usual alignment-based methods will have difficulty to conduct genus-level assignment. In our work, CHEER will first use rejection layer to remove the reads not belonging to the RNA virus. Second, the \"Order classifier\" will be applied to evaluate how many reads can be classified into Mononegavirales order. Third, \"Mononegavirales classifier\" takes all these Mononegavirales reads as input to predict how many reads will be assigned to the Filoviridae family. Finally, \"Filoviridae classifier\" is adopted to check how many reads belong to the Ebola genus. Fig. 8 show the ROC curve of the rejection layer. True positive rate reveals how many Ebolavirus reads pass the rejection layer. The false positive rate reveals how many gut bacterial reads pass the rejection layer. We generated thresholds from 0 to 1 with step size 0.01 and used each threshold for the rejection layer. Then for each threshold, we recorded the true positive rate and false positive rate for plotting the ROC curve. As shown in Fig. 8 , with the increase of the threshold, more bacterial reads are filtered by the rejection layer, at the expense of missing more real Ebola reads. The default threshold for the rejection layer is 0.6 in CHEER. User can adjust the threshold according to their needs. After evaluating the rejection layer, we continued to test the hierarchical classification performance at each rank. We first compared our tree model with NBC. Then we also benchmarked CHEER with the method using protein-level alignment in Section 3.3.3. The performance of the complete hierarchical classification pipeline of NBC and CHEER is shown in Fig. 9 . From order to genus, each bar shows the accuracy of correctly classified reads by the parent classifier. For example, NBC correctly classified 1580 at the order level. Then, 1564 out of the 1580 reads are correctly labeled at the family level. While Fig. 4 , 5, and 6 have shown the performance of CHEER and NBC at each taxonomic rank using the same set of reads as input for each level of classifiers, this experiment focused on comparing the hierarchical classification pipeline using only correctly predicted reads by the parent classifier. The results demonstrated that CHEER can classify Ebola reads with better performance. NBC can only classify 1,564 (57.1%) reads into Ebolavirus. CHEER, however, had totally 2407 (87.9%) reads classified correctly. Although nucleotide-level alignment models are not ideal choices for predicting new species, as mentioned in [8] , protein-level alignment such as BLASTx is still frequently used for homology search because of the conservation among homologous protein sequences. We followed VirusSeeker [10] , which is a BLASTx based model, to align translated reads to virus-only protein database (VIRUSDB NR) provided by NCBI. Then, we kept alignments with E-value cutoff 0.001, which is used in VirusSeeker. The output of BLASTx shows that a read can often align to multiple proteins, making the phylogenetic classification ambiguous (see Fig. 11 ). Also, existing tools such as VirusSeeker often use the best alignment only, which does not always yield the highest accuracy. To optimize the usage of the alignment-based method, we implemented k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm to record the best k alignments rather than only using the best one. The label of the input read is determined by the majority vote in the labels of the top k alignments. According to Fig. 10 , most of the reads have hit numbers between 11 to 15 and 6 to10. Thus, we chose 1, 5, 10, 15 as our k when running kNN. There are also 512 reads that cannot be aligned with any VIRUSDB protein sequence. All these reads will be regarded as wrong prediction. Fig. 11 shows the classification results of kNN. When we use the best hit as the prediction the accuracy is only 64%. The best performance of kNN will be 74% with 2,026 correct predictions when k is 5. But the accuracy sharply decreases if k is larger than 5. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 also revealed that it is hard for users to choose a proper k in real classification tasks. The most common value of the hit number is 11-15 shown in Fig. 11 . The best kNN result, however, has a k equal to 5. Thus, comparing to this alignment-based method, CHEER, with 2,407 (87.9%) reads classified correctly, is more practical and reliable. The two main purposes of the early stop function are: 1) to handle the cases of a new species from an unseen genus or higher ranks; 2) to serve as a quality control measure for preventing wrong classifications in child classifiers. As Fig. 6 shows, the higher rank classification tends to be more accurate than lower ranks. Because the genus of Ebolavirus exists in our classification tree, the evaluation of the early stop function focuses on the second purpose. Fig. 12 shows the percentage of how many reads are classified into Ebolavirus genus correctly for different classifiers. By allowing early stop, the number of wrong predictions decreased sharply. In short, although there are fewer reads being labelled at the genus level, the total number of reads with wrong classification is decreased. Thus, this is still a useful feature provided by CHEER. Another significant advantage of CHEER is the high classification speed. Although training the model uses heavy computing resources, the inference procedure of this algorithm is fast. And with the help of GPU acceleration, the training time also decreases a lot. In the experiments shown in Section 3.4, it takes around 46 minutes to run BLASTx against the virus protein database. Our method, however, only takes 7 second for the preprocessing step to convert the raw sequence into a vector, and then takes less than 35 second to make the prediction for all 2,737 reads. In this work, all training data are RNA virus genomes downloaded from the NCBI RefSeq database. The training reads are extracted uniformly from the genome to make sure that classifiers can learn the features from the whole genome. To evaluate the model on new species detection, all species in the test set are excluded from the training data. Error rates are also added to evaluate the robustness of the model. The results reveal that the model is tolerant to the sequencing error. In addition, a SoftMax threshold rejection layer is applied to filter reads from non-RNA viruses. The SoftMax threshold in each classifier will also help early stop classification with low confidence and thus decreases the wrong predication rate. We show a case study on real-world data to identify how this threshold will influence the rejection classifier and early stop function. The results show that CHEER competes favorably with state-of-the-art tools.","authors":["Jiayu","Yanni"],"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Powerhouse\\Documents\\GitHub\\Project-ScIRank\\Scout\\test_data\\test_json\\00911cf4f99a3d5ae5e5b787675646a743574496.json"},{"id":4,"title":"A Combined Evidence Approach to Prioritize Nipah Virus Inhibitors","abstract":" Nipah Virus (NiV) came into limelight recently due to an outbreak in Kerala, India. NiV causes severe disease and death in people with over 75% case fatality rate. It is a public health concern and has the potential to become a global pandemic. Lack of treatment has forced the containment methods to be restricted to isolation and surveillance. WHO's 'R&D Blueprint list of priority diseases' (2018) indicates that there is an urgent need for accelerated research & development for addressing NiV. In the quest for druglike NiV inhibitors (NVIs) a thorough literature search followed by systematic data curation was conducted. Rigorous data analysis was done with curated NVIs for prioritizing druglike compounds. For the same, more than 1800 descriptors of NVIs were computed and comparative analysis was performed with the FDA approved small molecules and antivirals. These compounds were further evaluated through PAINS filter to study their toxicity profile. Simultaneously, compounds were also prioritized based on the robustness of the assays through which they were identified. Our efforts lead to the creation of a well-curated structured knowledgebase of 182 NVIs with 98 small molecule inhibitors. The reported IC50/EC50 values for some of these inhibitors are in the nanomolar range -as low as 0.47 nM. In order to prioritize these inhibitors, we performed several tests and applied filters to identify drug-like non-toxic compounds. Of 98, a few compounds passed DruLito & PAINS filters exhibiting drug-like properties and were also prioritized in an independent screen based only the assay robustness. The NVIs have diverse structural features and offer a wide spectrum of ways in which they can be developed further as druglike molecules. We report a knowledgebase for furthering the development of NVIs. The platform has a diverse set of 98 NVIs of which a few have been prioritized based on a combined evidence strategy. The platform has the provision to submit new inhibitors as and when reported by the community for further enhancement of NiV inhibitor landscape.","full_text":" Nipah is an infectious negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus which belongs to the genus henipavirus and family Paramyxoviridae [1] . It is a pleomorphic enveloped virus with a particle size ranging from 40 to 1,900nm [2] . While fruit bats are thought to be the natural reservoirs of the virus, they are also able to spread to humans and some other species [3] . There are two major genetic lineages of the virus which are known to infect humans i.e, NIV Malaysia (NIV M ) and NIV Bangladesh (NIV B ) [2] . The first outbreak of Nipah virus infection erupted between September 29,1998 , and April 4, 1999, when cases of febrile encephalitis in the suburb of Ipoh, Perak, Southern Peninsular Malaysia were reported to the Malaysian Ministry of Health (MOH) [4] . It was traced back to cross-species transmission of the virus from pigs to humans [4, 5] . In 2001 another strain of the virus was reported to cause an outbreak in Meherpur, Bangladesh. Since then outbreaks have been recorded almost annually in the country and surrounding regions such as Siliguri, India [6, 7] . Most of the outbreaks have been observed to have a mortality rate ranging from 50-100% [8] . Although direct contact with the infected bat's contaminants could cause transmission of the virus, direct human-to-human transmission has also been observed in the case of healthcare professionals and relatives of infected patients [9, 10] . More recently, the virus has garnered attention due to the first-ever outbreak in southern India during May of 2018 where 19 cases of NiV were reported in Kozhikode, Kerala. In the subsequent year, 2019, another case was reported in Ernakulam district of the state [11, 12] . Nipah virus causes cell-to-cell fusion in the host thus forming multinucleated cells called syncytia. This allows the virus to spread despite the absence of viral budding and greatly influences its pathogenicity [13, 14] . The  incubation  period  of  the  virus  ranges  from  5  to  14 days (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/nipah/pdf/factsheet.pdf). Primarily the virus infects the central nervous system but the NIV B strain has been shown to have significant respiratory involvement [2] . High mutation rate, human to human transmission, survival time of up to 4 days under various environmental conditions and lack of treatment makes it a potential bioterrorism agent [15, 16] . Currently, there is no known treatment for the disease. Broad-spectrum antiviral ribavirin has shown contradictory results with even the most optimistic ones significantly below 50% in causing reduction of the mortality rate [17, 18, 19] . Favipiravir (T-705), a purine analogue antiviral, is reported to provide protection to upto 14 days in the Syrian hamster model challenged with a lethal dose of Nipah virus [20] . More recently, experimental drug remdesivir has demonstrated complete protection to four African green monkeys who received a lethal dose of Nipah virus. Studies are planned to assess the efficacy of the treatment over time [21] . Despite being a lethal pathogen there is not a single drug under clinical trial against this virus. Due to several challenges in discovery and development of NVIs, along with lack of therapeutic intervention and the pathogenic propensity of the virus, Nipah infections are enlisted amongst WHO's list of priority diseases [22] . As mentioned above, various groups have made efforts over the years to identify Nipah virus inhibitors using a variety of viral assays. Most of them have used syncytia formation or titre reduction assays to identify Nipah virus inhibitors. Some of the earlier studies report nipah inhibitors based on screening of large libraries within BSL-4 settings to identify compounds that inhibited the virus-induced cytopathic effect. Three sulfonamide compounds with low EC50 values are reported [23] from these screens. More recently, Bimolecular Multicellular Complementation assays have been developed which can be used to identify potential anti-nipah inhibitors by qualitatively and quantitatively investigating the formation of a syncytium [24] . Also reported recently is a humanized monoclonal antibody for cross-neutralizing NiV and HeV. Cryo-electron microscopy followed by fusion studies demonstrated that the antibody binds to a prefusion-specific quaternary epitope which is conserved in NiV F and HeV F glycoproteins. The binding prevents membrane fusion and viral entry and clearly indicates the importance of the HNV prefusion F conformation for eliciting a robust immune response [25] . Despite reports of nipah virus inhibitors, no systematic evaluation of the reported compounds is performed. A few antiviral inhibitor databases and studies exist, namely, The Influenza Research Database (IRD) [26] [27] , The Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) [28] , enamine library (https://enamine.net/hit-finding/focused-libraries/view-all/antiviral-library), etc. They contain very limited or no information with the focus on Nipah virus. The ones with focus on Nipah virus inhibitors are either scattered datasets or curated versions with limited or no evaluation of the anti-Nipah compounds as starting points for drug discovery and development of anti-Nipah inhibitor(s) [29] . Towards this, we developed a combined evidence based strategy to systematically evaluate Nipah virus inhibitors. With this objective, we curated the anti-Nipah compounds using a crowdsourcing model and the data were made publicly available at -http://vinodscaria.rnabiology.org/nipah since the inception of the project (May 2018). Our two pronged strategy comprised of (i) prioritization of NVIs based on the robustness of the assays which were used to identify them and (ii) estimation of several drug likeness parameters for the NVIs. The drug likeness analysis includes diversity analysis, similarity to FDA approved compounds (as drug repurposing candidates) or reported antivirals (to identify new scaffolds), profiling based on PAINS and DruLito filters and comparison to ZINC lead like libraries. The data curated from literature along with all these analyses is made available on a web-based platform which also allows submission and assessment of new molecules reported as NVIs. PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) and Google (https://www.google.com/) were the two main sources considered for collecting the inhibitors that showed activity against Nipah virus. Research papers relevant to the study were downloaded using the query as 'Nipah' and those with the keyword in their abstract/title were shortlisted. At the time of curation this keyword listed 838 papers which were considered for data-mining. This step was followed by a scoring system wherein papers that had confirmed information regarding the inhibitors against Nipah virus in their abstracts were assigned a score of '10', those that may or may not have information regarding the same were given a score of '5', those with information on peptides used as inhibitors were assigned a score of '4' and rest with no relevant information were given a score of '0'. Papers with score values of 10, 5 and 4 were considered for further study and all of them were manually curated to create a Nipah Virus Inhibitor Knowledgebase (NVIK) sheet which is used by all the curators to organize data based on a predefined data structure shown below in Table 1 . Inhibitor Name -as reported in literature Assay type  In order to ensure data quality, a separate team of curators re-performed the curation independent of the initial team. Errors are marked in 'Red' in the curation sheet and was then marked 'Green' once the data is verified by both the teams. Data curation and quality check was done manually and the data is stored in NVIK-Open resource Sheet which served as the crowdsourcing platform. Each entry was tagged with its contributor's email Id. The Nipah Virus Inhibitor Knowledgebase (NVIK) is developed using the open source LAMP (Linux-Apache-Mysql-PHP) server technology. We have also used PHP, HTML, JavaScript, AJAX and CSS. The web-interface has provision for text, structure and complex query based search and other options for browsing. In the NVIK web interface, three search options are available, namely, 'Simple Search', 'Query Builder' and 'Structure Search'. The Simple Search option is to retrieve information using a text-based query on all/selected fields of the database. User can selectively display the searched records. Overall, the database contains -unique fields as shown in Figure 1 . An extensive 'Structure Search' interface is also available in NVIK. The user can query using SMILES, SDF and MOL formats. In addition, the users can also draw a compound in JSME browser that may be searched in NVIK. Data on NVIs can be browsed for physicochemical properties like molecular weight, XLogP, polar surface area (PSA), hydrogen bond donor (HBD), hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and the number of rotatable bonds (http://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/anshu/nipah/physico_chem.php). The database can also be browsed from major fields as shown in Figure 1 .  We have customized a CIRCOS [31] (http://circos.ca/) in one of our earlier studies on phytomolecules in mycobacteria [32] . We utilized a similar approach to represent the relationship among physicochemical properties of NVIs. In customized CIRCOS, 98 inhibitors are defined with a band having a width of 1000. This baseline is used to represent cyclic and aliphatic compounds. Appropriate modifications were then applied to generate further histogram files. To view the the compounds clusters, a compound network diagram (CND) was made using Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org/). At present, NVIK has 182 entries. The focus of the study was to evaluate small molecule inhibitors which were 125 entries as the rest 57 were either peptide or did not have complete information. Of these 125 entries, 98 are unique nipah inhibitors as for a few compounds more than one assay has been curated from the literature. Of these, EC50/IC50 values could be obtained for 70 compounds and structures are available for all 98 inhibitors. The EC50/IC50 values range from 0.25 nM to 7562710 nM for 182 entries and 0.47 nM to 7562710 nM for 125 small molecule entries. Some of these compounds are available in DrugBank and are predicted to have anti-nipah properties. The NVIK compounds are also mapped to Pubchem/Chemspider IDs wherever possible. The overall distribution of important physicochemical properties of NVIs is depicted in Figure 2 . It can be observed that most compounds in NVIK are cyclic in nature. Clustering of 98 NVIs resulted in 90 clusters of which 84 clusters (93.3% of NVIs) were singletons while remaining 14 clusters (15.5% of NVIs) were non-singletons. This illustrates that the NVIK library is chemically diverse. These clusters are represented as compound network diagrams made using Cytoscape. (http://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/anshu/nipah/circos.php) and the clusters are also reported in CIRCOS. The innermost graph in Figure 2 represents the near neighbours among NVIs. An intriguing observation is that compounds with different molecular weight range are near neighbours. For example, GS-441524 (531.202 g/mol) is a near neighbour of GS-441524 (\"NUC\") (291.267 g/mol). There may be common structural features in these compounds that are responsible for their activity against NiV (as highlighted). Therefore, this approach is useful in identifying potential pharmacophore features that are important in contributing to the antiviral properties of these compounds. Comparison of NVIs is done with FDA approved compounds (2346) and antivirals obtained from Enamine library (4644). Enamine is a library of nucleoside like compounds (https://enamine.net/hitfinding/focused-libraries/view-all/antiviral-library). On the basis of physicochemical properties as suggested by Lipinski and Veber [33] it is observed that for the majority of NVIs, the distribution of all the six properties is similar to FDA approved drugs and also in some cases with Enamine compounds (Figure 3 ). Drugs with good oral availability, demonstrate TopoPSA ≤ 140 Å2 and number of rotatable bonds ≤ 10.  In total, there are 34 NVIs similar to 76 FDA approved drugsf. For e.g, 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (NVIC0097) has shown structural similarity against four FDA molecules, namely, Adenosine (a neurotransmitter), Vidarabine (active antiviral against herpes, vaccinia & varicella zoster virus), Fludarabine (a chemotherapy drug) and Ademetionine (used in the treatment of chronic liver diseases). In addition, side effects and predicted rat toxicity as reported in DrugBank is also listed for FDA approved compounds similar to NVIs (http://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/anshu/nipah/fda_app.php). This can aid in prioritization of NVIs with a potential safe profile as opposed to the ones which have reported side effects. . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder.

As can be seen from Figure 4 only two of 91 compounds passed all filters other than CMC filter.  In order to prioritize NVIs for further studies, we performed an independent evaluation of the compounds based on the robustness of the assays that were used to identify them. Based on this analysis, we prioritised 11 NVIs. Further analysis of these NVIs also indicated that they have physicochemical descriptor values which are closer to existing drug like FDA approved compounds. Our analysis of FDA approved compounds for several physicochemical parameters namely molecular weight, number of hydrogen bond donors, number of hydrogen bond acceptors, number of rotatable bonds, XlogP and topological polar surface area revealed that most prioritized NVIs have drug like features. As can be seen from Table 2 exhibits better activity among the three and has considerable overlap with the physicochemical properties of FDA approved drugs. The scope of the current study was to perform a systematic evaluation of physicochemical properties of NVIs with respect to FDA approved drugs and antiviral libraries, understand the diversity of chemical scaffolds and correlate these computed properties with the experimentally reported bioactivity datasets for proposing a list of prioritized candidates.

It has been determined that the pathogen causing the viral pneumonia among affected individuals is a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1, 3] . The pathogen exhibits high human-to-human transmissibility and has spread rapidly within and beyond Wuhan city [4, 5] . On January 30 th , 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [6] . Wuhan is central China's transportation hub with a population of 11 million residents and a large number of higher-education students (~1.3 million in 89 universities and colleges), a particularly mobile population [7] . Beyond these factors, viral spread was likely exacerbated further by the surge in domestic and international travel during the 40-day Lunar New Year (LNY) celebrations (from January 10 th , 2020 to February 18 th , 2020) -the largest annual human migration in the world, comprised of hundreds of millions of people travelling across the country. As of February 4 th , 2020, China has reported 20,530 confirmed cases and 23,314 suspected cases with 2019-nCoV infections [8] . Of the confirmed cases, 2788 are severe and 426 people have died. Most cases were reported from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province, and all provinces have confirmed cases imported from Wuhan and secondary transmission has been reported in some provinces. Additionally, there were 153 cases reported in 23 countries outside of China, with most having a travel history involving Wuhan [6] . The potential pathway from this local outbreak in Wuhan to a pandemic might involve four steps: i) local transmission in Wuhan (primary city of epidemic); ii) spread from Wuhan to other cities within and beyond China via infected travellers, causing sporadic secondary transmission in these cities (secondary city of epidemic), iii) further spreading from secondary cities with local transmission to other tertiary cities in China and international cities via returning travellers after the LNY holiday; iv) onward transmission across multiple countries and leading to a pandemic. To interrupt the spread, a cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and surrounding cities in Hubei Province has been in place since January 23 rd , 2020, just two days before the LNY's Day. However, significant numbers of people had likely already travelled back to their hometowns for the holiday by this time. According to Wuhan authorities, it is .

Here we conducted a travel network-based analysis to explore patterns of domestic and international population movements from high-risk cities in China, and provide preliminary estimates of the potential risk of 2019-nCoV spreading across and beyond the country. Given the current epidemic and limited understanding of the epidemiology of this disease, our findings on travel patterns from historical data can help contribute to tailoring public health interventions. To identify the areas that are most vulnerable to virus importation, we performed and integrated a series of analyses, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone-based population movement data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports. We defined the potential risk and geographic range of 2019-nCoV virus spread across three scenarios: 1) from the primary city (Wuhan) into other cities in mainland China (31 provincial regions), 2) from high-risk secondary cities into other cities across China, and 3) from high-risk cities in mainland China into cities in other countries or regions during the LNY holiday and the following three months. We also estimated the number of airline travellers likely needing to be quarantined or screened to capture travellers potentially exposed to 2019-nCoV in high-risk cities of mainland China. To define daily patterns and the connectivity of population movements at county and prefecture (city) level across mainland China during the LNY holiday and the following three months, we used the aggregated and de-identified daily flow of the users of Baidu, the largest Chinese search engine [10] . Baidu offers location-based service (LBS), based on the global positioning system (GPS), IP address, location of signalling towers and WIFI, for online searching, mapping, and a large variety of apps and software for mobile devices. These data have been used to visualize population migration around Chinese New Year [10] . Two Baidu datasets were used in this study. The first one covers daily movement data at county level from December 1 st , 2013 to April 30 th , 2014, as described elsewhere [11] . We calculated relative .

Relative netflow = (inflow -outflow) / population of each county The second dataset is a more recent daily movement matrix at the city level based on data from Baidu's search app from January 1 st , 2015 to April 30 th , 2015. The last recorded locations of a user (or device) for each day were compared, and if the location changed, then we counted the user (or device) as someone who had moved from one city to another city. To understand the spread risk of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan into other cities via domestic population movement, we aggregated daily outflows of people from Wuhan to other cities across mainland China for the two weeks (the quarantine period of the virus) prior to the cordon sanitaire of Wuhan. As the travel ban took place on January 23 rd , 2020, just 2 days before LNY's day, and given that LNY's day in 2015 was February 19 th , we took February 17 th , 2015 as a reference of the lockdown day in our dataset. Using the second dataset, then the risk of importation for each destination city or province was preliminarily defined as the percentage of travellers received by each city or province out of the total volume of travellers leaving Wuhan during the two weeks before the city's lockdown. These secondary cities may have a high risk of community-level transmission through the introduction of infected travellers from Wuhan, and then spread the virus to other tertiary cities by returning population movements after the LNY holiday, causing an even wider spread of the virus. As most of the cities in Hubei province have implemented the same travel controls as Wuhan before LNY, we defined the high-risk secondary cities outside of Hubei province as the cities within top 30 ranked cities (Supplementary Table S1 ) with the highest risk of importation from Wuhan defined above. Based on the 2015 Baidu dataset on population movement, the risk of spreading the virus from high-risk secondary cities to tertiary cities was preliminarily calculated as the averaged percentage of travellers received by each tertiary city out of the total volume of travellers leaving each high-risk secondary city during the four weeks following LNY's Day. We chose a period of four weeks because the returning flow of LNY's population movement, Chunyun, generally lasts four weeks. .

IATA data accounts for approximately 90% of passenger travel itineraries on commercial flights, and these data represent direct origin (Wuhan) to destination trips, and indirect trips that originated in Wuhan, but had connecting flights to a final destination. We quantified monthly volumes of airline travellers departing Wuhan and high-risk secondary cities from February 1 st , 2018, through April 30 th , 2018. With the assumption that the population movements around the LNY holiday in 2020 was consistent with the pattern in 2018, all final destinations were ranked by volumes of airline travellers, and the relative risk of importation was defined as the percentage of airline travellers received by each destination city out of the total volume of travellers leaving high-risk cities in China. We also estimated the number of airline travellers that may have needed to be kept in quarantine from Wuhan during the two weeks prior to the city's travel ban. The LNY's day in 2018 was on February 16 and the lockdown of Wuhan happened two days before LNY's day, corresponding to the date of February 14 th , 2018. We therefore defined the number of travellers needing to be quarantined as half of the volume of airline travellers from Wuhan in February, 2018, representing the 2-week total number of travellers for the first half of February. We then estimated the number of infections and its 95% uncertainty interval (UI) in these airline travellers from Wuhan, based on a binomial distribution and the proportion of 2019-nCoV infections in the citizens evacuated from Wuhan reported by Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Germany, as of January 31 st , 2020 [6, [14] [15] [16] [17] . Additionally, to capture travellers potentially exposed to virus, we also estimated the volume of airline travellers that would be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April. Considering air traffic flows from China have changed due to the airline flight cancellations, travel restrictions imposed by countries or regions, or changes in travel behaviours, we calculated the volume of travellers using different scenarios of reductions (50%, 75%, and 90%) in total passenger volumes. .

Additionally, we also compared the spatial patterns of the risks of Chinese cities importing the virus from Wuhan, estimated by the population movement data in 2014 and 2015, and more recent data on the top 50 ranked origin and destination cities in January 2020, available from the Baidu Migration site (https://qianxi.baidu.com/). To futher validate our results, we also compared the importation risk estimated in this study with the number of reported imported cases from Wuhan to other provinces in mainland China, as of January 25 th , 2020, and the number of imported cases reported by other countries or regions, as of February 3 rd , 2020 [6] . The distribution between days of travelling from Wuhan, illness onset, first medical visit, and hospitalization of imported cases, as of January 25 th , 2020, were also analysed. These case data were collated from the websites of WHO, national and local health authorities or new agencies within and beyond China (Supplementary Note). R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to perform data analyses. Significant migratory flows occurred in opposite directions before and after LNY's Day. In Wuhan City, mass movements of people began about three weeks prior to LNY, with the first peak of population leaving the city before the start of the winter holiday for universities, especially in the three counties that contain many universities and students (Figure 1 ). Although a cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and some cities in Hubei Province has been in place since January 23 rd , 2020, the timing of this may have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan, as another peak of movements out of the city was seen 2 days before LNY's day. We found that a large number of travellers were likely departing Wuhan into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China before Wuhan's .

Other cities in Hubei Province received huge amounts of people during the two weeks before LNY and showed a decreasing population since LNY, following a peak of outflow at the end of the LNY holiday (Figure 1b and Supplementary Table S2 ). If Wuhan's lockdown had not have been undertaken, our analyses suggest the main destination cities of population outflow since LNY would have been similar to the situation two weeks prior to LNY (Supplementary Table S3 ). In terms of the initial importation risk of virus for each city during the two weeks before Wuhan's lockdown, nearly all other cities in Hubei Province were estimated to be high-risk areas (Figure 2a ). Other places with high risks were Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other large cities. In terms of the provincial level, the risks were high in Guangdong and Hunan, followed by Henan and Zhejiang (Figure 2b ). There was a significant correlation (r-squared = 0.59, p < 0.001) between the number of imported cases and the risk of importation estimated from traveller numbers from Wuhan within the two weeks before LNY's Day (Figure 3a ). Further, a high proportion of cases travelled with symptoms at the early stage of the outbreak, and the lag from illness onset to hospitalization decreased from a median of 6 days (Interquartile range: 4-7 days) in the first half of January 2020 to 3 days (1-5 days) in the second half ( Figure 4 ). According to our definition outlined in the methods, the 17 high-risk secondary cities outside of Hubei Province were identified as: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Changsha, Xi'an, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Nanchang, Chengdu, Hefei, Fuzhou, and Dongguan ( Figure 5) . Should community-level outbreaks occur in these cities, they could contribute to further spread of infection to other highly connected cities within China via movement after the holiday (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 ). Based on historical air travel data, the connectivity and spread risk between high-risk cities in mainland China and cities in other countries or regions was defined for the three months around the LNY holiday (Supplementary Figure S3 and Tables S4 and S5). Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Taipei ranked in the top three, followed by Seoul, Tokyo and Singapore. The main destinations were presented by region in the supplemental materials (Supplementary Figures S3-S9 and Table S4 -S7). During the two weeks before Wuhan's lockdown, there were an estimated total 59,912 airline .

Thailand, Japan, and Taiwan ranked in the top three, followed by Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Based on an overall infection rate of 1.39% (16/1149; 95% UI: 0.80% -2.25%) in citizens evacuated from Wuhan before Table S8 ). As of February 3 rd , 2020, a significant correlation (r-squared = 0.58, p < 0.001) was seen between the number of imported cases reported in those countries or regions and the risk of importation via travellers defined in our study (Figure 3b ). Because significant intranational and international spread from Wuhan has already occurred, a very large number of airline travellers (6.5 million under the scenario of 50% travel reduction as usual, 3.3 million under 75% reduction, and 1.3 million under 90% reduction, respectively) would be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China ( Figure 5 ) and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 (Table 1 and  Supplementary Tables S9 and S10) , to ensure that all travellers from high risk cities were covered. Addtionally, based on monthly air passenger travel statistics and time series of public and school holidays in 91 countries from 2010 to 2018 (Supplementary Note), we found the seasonal pattens of domestic and international population movements across years were highly consistent with the timing and duration of public and school holidays in different countries (Supplementary Figure S10 and S11) . Moreover, we also found similar spatial patterns in the risks of Chinese cities importing the virus from Wuhan via population movements estimated by both the Baidu data in 2014 and 2015, and the more recent data covering the top 50 ranked destinations in 2020, (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S12) , highlighting the value of using historical data to rapidly assess present day risks.

Given the rapidly growing number of confirmed 2019-nCoV infections, increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission within and beyond China [4, 24] , and our limited understanding of this novel virus [25, 26] , the findings here from travel patterns in historical data and spread risk estimation can help guide public health preparedness and intervention design across the world [27] . In terms of domestic connectivity and risk, the high population outflows from three counties in Wuhan with many colleges and universities in the first two weeks of January were likely college students leaving the city to avoid the peak traffic just one week before the New Year. Because of the early timing of this movement, many students might have avoided the period when the virus spread rapidly in Wuhan, and their risk of spreading the virus may be low as well. However, our results suggest that during the two weeks prior to Wuhan's travel ban, a large number of travellers still departed Wuhan into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China and may have spread the virus to new areas, as the timing of the lockdown occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan. Further exacerbating this risk, we found that during the outbreak's initial stages, a particularly high proportion of cases travelled with illness caused by the virus, together with the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV through asymptomatic contacts, potentially causing additional transmission during travel [28] . Moreover, several destination cities ( Figure 5 ) outside of Hubei Province that received high volume of travellers from Wuhan prior to LNY's day may serve as significant secondary cities in the outbreak. Most of these cities have large populations and international airports, highly connected with other regions within and beyond China. The initial imported seed cases likely caused the local community transmission, and further spread the virus into wider geographical ranges following the population flows occurring due to the LNY holiday [19] . Therefore, substantial public health interventions have been immediately applied across the country since LNY, including the cordon sanitaire in several of the most affected cities, cancellation of mass gatherings, reduction of travel and contact rate, as well as the extension of the LNY and school winter holiday, which might mitigate subsequent local establishment of 2019-nCoV introduced by travellers. Beyond the cases that have occurred in China, air passengers have spread 2019-nCoV across countries and continents within a short time period [28, 29] . In particular, a high volume of international airline travellers left .

Substantial preparedness efforts at destination cities should be taken to prevent further international seeding and transmission, otherwise the local establishment of epidemics, and even a pandemic, might become inevitable. For example, exit and entry screening may be futher extended to capture travellers with fever who have potentially been exposed to the virus in high-risk Chinese cities where local transmission has been established. However, we estimated that a huge volume of airline travellers would be required to be screened in February to April, even under the scenario of significant reduction (90%) in air passengers compared with the same period of previous years. Therefore, ensuring that surveillance and health systems around the world are ready and sufficiently strong to detect and deal with cases seen is a priority. It is expected that further international exportation of cases from China will occur and cases may appear in any country [30] . Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of the 2019-nCoV infection [6, 31] . Of additional concern is that the anticipated destinations of hundreds of thousands of travellers departing China are to low-income or lower-middle income countries, where inadequately resourced medical and public health systems might be unable to detect and adequately manage an imported case of 2019n-CoV, including possible subsequent community spread. Due to current limited knowledge of the epidemiology of the virus at the time of writing (e.g. the proportion and infectiousness of asymptomatic or subclinical infections) and the rapidly changing situation of the outbreak, the simplicity of our approach to define importation risk can help to quickly update risk assessments, prioritise surveillance, target limited resources and understand the potential of 2019n-CoV introduction at specific destinations [32] . Compared with other studies [33, 34] , we explored the various scenarios of travel restriction and used a more comprehensive and spatio-temporally detailed population movement matrix, together with details on the actual final destination cities of air passengers based on the global itinerary dataset. These novel datasets provide new insights on the impacts of internal and international connectivity on potential transmission of this emerging pathogen during the LNY holiday and over the next three months. Nevertheless, it is important to note that our study has several major limitations. Firstly, while we do present simple scenarios of reduced air travel volumes, our primary analyses assume \"business as usual\" travel based on .

Second, the mobile phone data used may provide an incomplete and biased picture of travellers, as the data only cover the population owning a smart phone and using Baidu apps. Third, the case data used in this study likely varies in quality and completeness due to the timeliness of reporting, varying laboratory diagnosis capacities, and differences in details announced on health authority websites. Fourth, compared with airline travellers leaving Wuhan prior to January 23 rd evacuees from Wuhan during the January 29 th -31 st period might have a higher risk of infection due to their longer stay in Wuhan during the potential continued spread of the virus since January 23 rd . This may result in overestimates of the number of infections in airline travellers from Wuhan prior to the city's lockdown. Based on more recent population movement and epidemiological data, we aim to conduct more sophisticated modelling approaches to assess the effectiveness of control measures in China, the impact of movements of people returning from LNY holiday, as well as the risks of a 2019-nCoV global pandemic. .

[1] Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses which are broadly distributed either in humans or in a vast majority of other mammals and birds. These viruses have the possibility to cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases. [2, 3] Coronaviruses are highly prevalent in many species. They have a large genetic diversity. Given their RNA, they are susceptible to frequent recombination and mutations of their genomes. In context in which there are increasing human-animal interactions, novel coronaviruses are very likely to emerge periodically. If the newly created cross-species pathogens acquires the ability to infect humans or to be transmitted human to human it can lead to occasional spillover events and epidemics. [4, 5, 6] In the past years two other strains of Coronavirus -severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -have emerged as potential public health worldwide threats. [5] SARS-CoV was the causal agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in 2002 and 2003 in Guangdong Province, China; [7, 8, 9] MERS-CoV was the pathogen responsible for severe respiratory disease outbreaks in 2012 in the Middle East. [10] On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology detected in Wuhan City, located in the Hubei Province, China, associated with exposures in a seafood and wet wholesale market in the same city. A new type of coronavirus was isolated on 7 January 2020. [11] On 30 January 2020 WHO declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). [12] This novel coronavirus suddenly turned out to be a global health concern for a disease, called Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), [13] which was characterized as a pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020. [14] Starting from the second-half of January 2020, scientific literature has been particularly focused on the description of this new viral outbreak; the main topics addressed were the epidemiological, clinical and virological aspects as well as the possible public health choices necessary to contain the spread of the disease. Nevertheless, several aspects are still unclear and have not been thoroughly explored, leaving grey areas in our knowledge of the disease and of the outbreak. The aim of this paper is to perform a bibliometric analysis on the first papers published in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, in order to give a glimpse to the researchers of \"who published what\" at the very beginning of this Public Health Emergency of International Concern. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database in order to find all relevant studies. After a preliminary search starting from 1 December 2019, we found out that the first article meeting our inclusion criteria was published on 14 January 2020. [15] [Supplementary materials, Table 1 , ID: 1] We subsequently extended our research to the first 30 days after this milestone article, up to 13 January 2020. We decided to scan the reference lists of the reviews retrieved in order to find potential additional pertinent articles, and to test string sensitivity. The search string used was: coronavirus* OR Pneumonia of Unknown Etiology OR COVID-19 OR nCoV. The virus name was updated from \"2019-nCoV\" to \"SARS-CoV-2\" by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February 2020, [16] yet we performed the search using the term \"nCoV\" since we presumed that no paper published between 11 February 2020 and 13 February 2020 would have used the term \"SARS-COV-2\". To achieve the highest sensitivity, we decided to use only a combination of keywords avoiding Mesh terms. Asterisks are used to truncate words, so that every ending after the asterisks was searched. We placed a language restriction for English, without other limits to the search. The papers were than classified on the basis of a standardized list of key information including: Digital Object Identifier number (DOI), title, journal name, day of first publication (online or paper form), country of the first author affiliation, article type, source of the data and topics addressed. The topics addressed were identified according to 8 categories: generic discussion, epidemiology, virology, pathology and clinical presentation, diagnosis, therapy, transmission, preparedness. Articles that addressed more than a topic in an extensive way were accounted for more than one of the 8 topic categories; the papers that could not be classified in any of the 8 chosen topic categories were classified in the \"Other\" topic category. Eight of us (FS, EA, EB, EB, FE, FM, FS, SS) independently screened all identified articles. Procedure was carried out through title and abstract scanning in order to verify the inclusion criteria. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus between the reviewers. If disagreement persisted, another reviewer (DG) was called as tie-breaker. The \"Number Needed to Read\" (NNR) is defined as the ratio of the number of retrieved abstracts to the number of the ones which are pertinent for the research purpose. [17] We calculated the NNR to identify the proportion of papers which were not editorials and commentaries, as well as the proportion of papers with directly collected data. Chi2 test was used in order to test for significant differences in the comparison of percentages, using the statistical software STATA 15 (StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical Software: Release 15. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC). A total of 442 papers were retrieved; 234 articles were found to be pertinent (see Figure 1 ) and read in extenso in order to define their main characteristics. The affiliation of the first authors was distributed among 36 countries: 36.3% of the papers (85 out of 234) had a first author with a Chinese affiliation, 18.4% and 13.7% (43 out of 234 and 32 out of 234) had a first author with an affiliation from UK and USA respectively, while first authors affiliation from Canada accounted for 3.8% of the total (9 out of 234), from Italy for 3% (7 out of 234), and from Australia and Korea both accounted for 2.1% (5 out of 234 each). All the other countries accounted for less than 2% of the first author affiliations (less than 5 out of 234). 63.7% of the papers (149 out of 234) were editorials, commentaries or letters (mainly reported data). 10.7% of the papers (25 out of 234) were secondary papers, mainly narrative reviews, which collected the knowledge available up to that point on some specific topics (i.e. genomics of the virus, transmissibility, etc.). The remaining 25.6% (60 out of 234) were original primary studies: among these, case reports accounted for 43.3% of the total, while in vitro or in vivo studies or genomic studies accounted for 21.7% of the total. The remaining primary studies were cohort studies, case control studies and surveys. Chinese first authors published more original data and primary studies than authors from the UK and the USA (32.9% vs 4.7% of the UK and 6.3% of the USA; p<0.001), who published mostly editorials and commentaries. Of note, 61.5% of the analysed papers used reported/non original data and 15.8% used official data. Conversely, only 17.5% of the papers used data which were directly collected on the field. In 5.2% of the papers the source of the data was not clearly specified. The supplementary materials (Table 1) , available online, report all the findings of this review with the reference and description of the 234 papers selected for the bibliometric analysis.

The second most frequent topic was \"Preparedness\" (23.1%): 83.3% of these papers consisted of commentaries, and only 1 paper was a primary study. The \"Epidemiology\" topic was addressed in 15.4% of the papers, and only 2 (5.6%) were primary studies. The lack of primary studies could be observed also for the \"Virology\" topic (14.1%) and the \"Transmission\" topic (12.8%), with only 12 (36.4%) and 6 (20%) papers reporting original data, respectively. On the other hand, the \"Pathology and clinical characteristics\" topic (12.8%) consisted mostly of primary studies (22, 73.3%). \"Therapy\" topic was addressed in 12% of the papers, with 9 papers (33.3%) being primary studies. The least addressed topic was \"Diagnosis\" (9.4%), with 12 papers (54.5%) reporting original data. Finally, 3% of the papers were classified in the \"Other\" topic category. Table 1 , ID: 218] assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection in specialised laboratories into the European Union/European Economic Area countries. This paper emphasized the need for countries to put in place strong measures in order to detect and laboratory-confirm cases early. It was also highlighted the need to perform molecular testing (RT-PCR, as also indicated by the WHO [19] ) on different specimens including: nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage, oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, sputum, (endo) tracheal aspirate and nasal wash. The communication report also underlined the need for a clinical validation of the test specificity and sensitivity. If nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are the recommended types of specimen for diagnostic testing an interesting brief report published by Chinese authors [20] [Supplementary materials 165, 167, 197, 222] were published in the second half of the time frame selected, mostly by authors with a Chinese affiliation. These papers addressed several aspects of COVID-19 treatment, such as interferon inhalation, use of and efficacy of antiviral drugs, potential repurposing treatments with angiotensin receptor blockers, use of antibiotics for bacterial co-infections, and respiratory support therapy (e.g. oxygen saturation, CPAP, invasive mechanical ventilation). Interestingly, one paper published on 4 February 2020 [21] [Supplementary materials, Table 1 , ID: 91] investigated the possibility that the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect lung cells might be ACE2, a cell-surface protein on lung AT2 alveolar epithelial cells; one of the known regulators of endocytosis for the AT2 cells is the AP2associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1). The authors suggested the possibility to use high-affinity AAK1-binding drugs to inhibit endocytosis of AT2 cells, such as baricitinib (an oral, targeted All rights reserved.

From the second half of January to the first half of February the proportion of editorials and commentaries changed the NNR from 3.6 to 2.6, meaning that we passed from a mean 3.6 papers to read in order to find an non-editorial/commentary to 2.6 papers. The mean chance to read papers with directly collected data increased, with the NNR passing from 6.5 in January to 5.4 in February. The novel coronavirus infection that emerged two months ago (as already discussed, the new coronavirus was isolated on 7 January 2020) places emphasis on the importance of ensuring that health professionals, researchers and the public have the best possible scientific information. Bibliometrics is a scientific method widely used in many fields for quantifying and analysing published information. [22] This kind of literature analysis in the first month after the first publication in Pubmed shows a great number of papers published as expected, mainly by authors with a Chinese affiliation, followed by authors with an UK or USA affiliation. The reason for this distribution is ascribed to the fact that China is the country where the virus was originally isolated and the first one with a COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, we have to point out that, as shown in a commentary published in Nature, in recent years China produced more science PhD than any other country in the world and the Chinese government has been assuming a leading role in supporting its own scientific research. [23] Therefore the research and publication response to the outbreak has been prompt and lively, giving to the scientific community many elements for understanding the new infection. The second country with the highest number of publications was the UK, followed by the USA, probably due to the fact they are the most prolific countries for scientific research. Authors from the UK and the USA wrote mostly editorials and commentaries. The publication policies of many of the most important scientific journals were adapted to quickly review and publish scientific papers on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. This strategy facilitated the spread of new knowledge on the new infection and on the outbreak. Hence, it is important to have scientific shared papers in order to reduce misinformation which is itself a public health threat. [24] In the early scientific literature we analysed there is a lack of primary studies with original data, as expected, given the very short period of time considered after the first pertinent publication on the new infection. Nevertheless, editorials, news and commentaries are important to share opinions and the viewpoint of an expert or a panel of experts, rather than on producing new scientific evidence. the variety and severity of the presentation of COVID-19. Further publication and reviews on this topic are needed to summarize the knowledge arising from all the case reports. Diagnostic tools, except for CT scan, were poorly represented and discussed, especially in terms of molecular diagnosis and standardization of the techniques. The \"Therapy\" topic was also poorly represented, since more time is needed for clinical intervention studies. Analyzing the selected time frame, the percentage of the editorials, news and commentaries has decreased. This was highlighted particularly by our analysis, which shows that from the second half of January to the first half of February the proportion of editorials and commentaries lowered the NNR, thus indicating an increase in the level of evidence produced as well as the increase of primary data availability. There are several limitations in our study. First, we based our research only on PubMed, that does not index all of the scientific impacted journals. It is strongly recommended to consult more than one relevant database when performing systematic reviews of the literature, [25] even though it has been reported that most of the high-quality articles, like those included in Cochrane Reviews, are indexed in PubMed. [26] In addition, we excluded all the publications not in English. We acknowledge that, given the outbreak started in China, this may have led to a partial selection bias. Nevertheless, papers excluded which were written in Chinese and had an English abstract, were for the greatest part reports of the Chinese Government (data not shown). We considered only the articles published until 13 February 2020, and taking into account that literature is now changing day-by-day for this topic, extending the bibliometric research for the next months would be of paramount importance. In conclusion, as far as we know, our very early review is the first bibliometric study analyzing the early scientific research output about COVID-19 from a quantitative and descriptive standpoint. Due to the huge amount of interest and concern related to this outbreak, our analysis shows that the scientific publication has been very reactive but still preliminar, with an expected deficit of original data and an excess of editorials and commentaries. Further research is needed to review and synthesize the growing knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, with a special aim on the most important knowledge gaps in terms of diagnosis and effective preventive and therapeutic measures.

After triggering functional changes in ACE2/AT2R, an imbalance in the steady-state cytokine regulatory axis involving the Renin-Angiotensin System and IP-10 leads to a cytokine storm.","full_text":" The sudden outbreak of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of December 2019 poses a huge threat to human health worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes severe respiratory disease that can quickly spread from person to person and in some cases lead to death. Researchers have found that the new SARS-CoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses invade human cells in target tissues in a similar manner via high-affinity binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [1] . In recent epidemiological investigations of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and a preliminary study of the clinical characteristics of this disease [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , researchers have found that patients infected with the new coronavirus have severe symptoms similar to those of the SARS infection. The first batch of clinical data reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in China revealed \"cytokine storms\" in critically ill patients [7, 8] . However, the mechanism of the viral infection and pathological changes in the immune system is still lacking. The sooner this information is added to the current clinical knowledge of these viruses, the better the control and treatment of this disease. Here, we present an automated topic-wise inference method called TWIRLS (Topic-wise inference engine of massive biomedical literatures) for processing the massive biomedical literature to summarize coronavirus host-related entities. TWIRLS is capable of collecting, classifying, and analyzing reported coronavirus studies to reveal these entities based on the distribution of specific genes in the text of the articles. By combining with general protein interaction data, links between certain functional cellular/physiological components can be inferred to fill the knowledge gaps on the probable mechanism of host pathological changes. eventually leads to acute lung injury in the host. Therefore, TWIRLS can be used to guide human researchers by providing further potential therapeutic target information for the treatment of acute viral lung injury based on the regulation of RAS. Coronavirus-study specific entities and host genes As of February 21, 2020, the PubMed database included 14,878 biomedical articles on coronaviruses. We obtained text data (called local samples) from all related articles on the coronavirus that had been peer reviewed and published by human experts, which included the title, abstracts, author and affiliation information (total 3,182,687 words). The goal of the literature mining was to identify host genes and entities that are relevant to coronavirus research and to establish connections between them. An entity can refers to a word or phrase of the concept name (including related concepts, e.g., virus structure and chemical composition, source of infection, and virus type). The gene names were defined using the mammalian official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Naming Committee (HGNC) database. We directly retrieved 667 candidate genes from the local samples. By establishing a random distribution of one of the candidate genes in a control sample, the significance of this gene appearing in the local samples can be determined when the frequency of the current gene is an outlier of the random distribution of the control samples (see Methods for details). By calculating the odds ratio, we can also further determine the specificity of the association between this gene and the local samples. In this paper, we selected an odds ratio > 6 as the threshold for this judgment, which resulted in 123 coronavirus study-specific host genes (CSHGs). To determine the specificity of the entity, we made a choice between different texts in the local samples. We removed numbers, symbols, verbs, and garbled characters to obtain clean versions of the local samples. The coronavirus study-specific entities (CSSE) were then identified in only the clean texts containing CSHGs. Based on the clean selected samples, we next built a local dictionary of candidate CSSEs containing 49,293 words after deduplication. Before calculating the random distribution of each entity, we included the synonymous entities into a same entity number (including singular or plural words, active and passive forms, different tenses, suffixes that do not change the meaning, etc.). For example, synonymous entities such as coronaviral, coronavirus, coronaviruses were grouped into one entity as coronavirus and assigned the same number (see entity number in Table S1 , Sheet 1 first column). The previous method of merging synonymous entities was based on a dictionary [9, 10] , which not only relied on the integrity of the dictionary, but also required a long retrieval time. To automatically solve the synonymous entity problem, TWIRLS classifies similar strings based on whether there is a significant statistical association between the character blocks in a set of candidate entities including various synonymous entities (see Methods). After cleaning and processing, CSSEs were identified by TWIRLS using a similar method to that for CSHG as described above. For the candidate CSSE dictionary, a random distribution model for each entity was built by TWIRLS using the control samples. We identified 623 CSSEs (Table Sl, Sheet 1) based on the outliers discriminated by the random model and calculated odds ratio. For example, TWIRLS found 100 CSSEs close to ACE2, the receptor of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 viruses (see left panel in Figure 1 ). The size of the entity represents the relative distance to ACE2, with a larger size indicating a closer distance to ACE2. Additionally, we present the CSSE cloud of the human receptor gene DPP4 of the MERS virus (see right panel in Figure 1 ). Although TWIRLS only identified 623 CSSEs after collation, for human researchers, the information is scattered in words, which is limited for reconstructing understandable mechanistic models. Therefore, TWIRLS clusters CSSEs according to the rules defined by CSHG distribution, as genetic level research can accurately answer and solve physiological and pathological problems. TWIRLS first calculated the specific co-distribution between CSHGs in local samples, then determined the distance between each pair of CSSEs and performs dichotomy clustering according to the linkage relationship between CSSEs and CSHGs. This classified the 623 entities into 32 categories represented as C0-C31 (see category number in Table S1 , Sheet 1 second column). In addition, for each category, TWIRLS also cited the top ten most relevant references for human researchers (Table S2) . Therefore, in any category, according to the CSSE and the most relevant literature, we can quickly provide \"Labels of conclusion-drawn-by-human-researcher\" (HR Labels) for this category. This label outlines the most relevant research directions of the current entity category. For example, for category C3, the HR label is \"Neurotrophic Coronavirus Related to Immune-Mediated Demyelination\". We have summarized the HR labels for the 32 entity categories in Table 1 . The relative position of any CSHG to a certain CSSE can be estimated by TWIRLS (see Table S1 , the ranking matrix in Sheet 1). As each category contains different entities, we can determine whether a certain CSHG is significantly closer to each entity in the current category based on the ranking matrix between CSHG and CSSE. For example, the average distance between ACE2 and the 92 entities in category C5 is first calculated, then a random distribution model of the average distance between ACE2 and any of the 92 entities (3000-5000 times) is built, and finally, we determine if the average distance between ACE2 and entities in category C5 is significantly less than and deviates from the mean of the random distribution (Z score = -5.8416). The significance of each category associated with each CSHG is then scored by TWIRLS ranging between -10 and +10, with a smaller score indicating the current CSHG is more relevant to the current category (see the Z-score matrix in Table S1 , sheet 2). For an entity category, the associated CSHGs (e.g., Ci CSHGs, where i represents the category number) can thus be selected by a Z score <-3 (the Z scores describing the association between CSHG and any category is summarized in Sheet2 of Table S1 , and the category labels of all CSHGs are provided in Sheet 3). Specifically, Spike proteins (S proteins) of different coronaviruses recognize different receptor molecules on human cells, such as ACE2 (binds to Spike proteins in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 virus) and DPP4 (binds to Spike protein in MERS virus). We found that these two genes are assigned to the C5 category, which has a corresponding HR label of \"Spike protein (S) of coronavirus\", suggesting that TWIRLS can automatically provide an interface to summarize human findings and help human experts quickly understand the research directions and necessary knowledge in this field. The distribution and meaning of the data can be compared to specific expression values of CSHG under different conditions (here, the category is used as a condition).

On the other hand, TWIRLS can also recommend the most likely and least likely categories for each signaling pathway. As an example, Table 3 shows the signaling pathways most likely associated with category C3 with the most unlikely corresponding category. We coupled the data with gene interaction/regulation databases and constructed a generalized protein-protein interaction network (PPI network) among 119 genes out of the 123 CSHGs. We defined the direct interaction between two genes as a 1 degree (1 o ) interaction, and the indirect interaction connecting two genes through a gene as a 2 degree (2 o ) interaction. All the genes in the 1 o networks mined in the PPI database are shown in Figure 2 . The results after deduplication showed 2,004 pairs in the 119 CSHGs (see Table S1 , Sheet 4). As a control, the average interactions of 119 randomly selected genes in the database showed between 252 to 612 pairs (average 220.16, standard deviation 35.15). Compared to random genes, the regulatory connections between CSHGs were significantly enriched (Z score = 50.97). Those CSHGs associated with a certain category had much closer interactions. For example, CSHGs associated with category C3 (or associated with C5 or C10) were closer to each other in the 1 o networks (Figure 2 ), suggesting that TWIRLS can possibly highlight important research directions and biology systems involved in coronavirus-specific research and can provide reliable interfaces for further automatic inference. Several hub genes among the 119 CSHGs were further recommended by TWIRLS. Compared to a random sampling from all interactions recorded in the database, these hub genes had significantly increased numbers of interactions with the other 118 CSHGs. The recommended results showed that the three members of the IFITMs family (IFITM1-3) ranked first, second, and sixth among the top ten hub genes (CSSE cloud of the IFITMs family genes is shown in Figure 3 ; detailed ranking recommendation results are shown in Table S1 , Sheet 5). These IFITMs genes showed 115 interactions, accounting for 8.59% out of all 1,338 interactions of the 119 CSHGs. These IFITMs were significantly enriched in the local samples representing updated coronavirus-related All rights reserved.

The IFITMs family plays crucial roles in the induction of interferons during viral infections. Under the action of interferon, IFITMs disrupts intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and prevents the virus from entering the host cell [11] . However, TWIRLS did not directly associate IFITMs with any category, so we needed to provide more information so that TWIRLS can determine which part of these genes might be involved in the coronavirus infection and host body response. Combining with generalized interaction databases provides richer interactions and regulatory linkages. We extended the 119 CSHGs to their 2 o networks based on the interactions with higher likelihood of connections (Combined score> 800). The 2 o networks expanded the number of genes from 119 host genes to 3,494 genes that may be associated with coronavirus (see Table S1 , Sheet 6 with DPP4 [12] . The different distribution of these receptors in the respiratory tract results in different degrees of infection. Although the infection ability of MERS is lower than in SARS, the mortality is higher (in about one-third of patients) because of the deeper infection site [13] . Similar to the SARS virus, viral genomics and structural biology studies have shown that ACE2 is also a functional receptor for the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. After binding to ACE2 via its Spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes membrane fusion and enters the host cells by endocytosis. The ACE2 peptidase is a key regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS). It is highly expressed in the heart, kidney, and testis, and is also expressed at lower levels in other tissues (mainly in the intestine and lungs) [14, 15] . Recent studies have shown that the binding of the S protein to ACE2 in the new coronavirus is 10 to 20 times stronger than in the SARS virus [16] , which may help the new coronavirus infect the host through the upper respiratory tract, significantly increasing its infectivity. Using TWIRLS, we were able to identify both ACE2 and DPP4 genes as CSHGs, and both were significantly associated with the C5 category. The HR label for this category is \"associated with S protein.\" In addition to ACE2 and DPP4, other CSHGs that are significantly associated with the C5 category include FURIN and TMPRSS2. The former may be required for the H7N1 and H5N1 influenza virus infections, probably via hemagglutinin-induced lysis, whereas the latter is widely reported to mediate and assist in the invasion of host cells by multiple viruses. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a serine protease that hydrolyzes and activates the spike glycoproteins of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC), Sendai virus (SeV) and human interstitial pneumovirus (HMPV), and 1,2,3 fusion glycoproteins of F0, 4a, and 4b human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) [17, 18] . The function of this gene is essential for the transmission and pathogenesis of influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2 and H7N9 strains). It is also involved in the hydrolysis and activation of hemagglutinin proteins, which are essential for viral infectivity [19, 20] . Although entities in the C5 category and in the cited literature mainly show that virus invasion is facilitated by virus-binding receptors and membrane proteases, the biological mechanism of the receptor binding to viruses leading to pathological changes has been reported less frequently.

These inferences are based on a process that finds new genes connected to different categories. The connected categories suggested potential regulatory relationships between different biological functions or phenotypes. The genes that serve as linkers are potential targets for gain-and loss-of-function experiments to identify those systems described by the meaningful entities in these categories. In this paper, TWIRLS found the 2 o networks showed connections with certain CSHGs associated with categories or with no category. For example, TWIRLS found that CSHGs in the 2 o connections of IFITM1 were mainly concentrated in the C3 category (see Figure 4 ). Interestingly, CSHGs in the 2 o connections of ACE2 and DPP4 associated with C5 category were also enriched in C3 category, inferring that the information summarized in C3 category probably describe the underlying mechanisms of the pathological changes after coronavirus infection. In our analysis, the signaling pathways in C3 were mainly RAS, Vitamin D and RXR activation, and Chemokine signaling, with RAS being the most significant (as shown in Table 3 , which summarizes C3-related signaling pathways). which then linked to C3-associated cytokines including CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCR2, and CXCR3 ( Figure 5 ). Subsequently, these linker genes may contain information on the biological mechanisms that may be important for understanding the disease. For example, TWIRLS recommended angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2 or AT2R) genes in the C3 category associated with ACE2. This supports that RAS is probably involved in the pathological changes caused by cytokine storms after S protein binds to ACE2, as suggested by other reports. We next used TWIRLS to calculate the 1 o and 2 o networks of all 119 CSHGs. Based on the significantly enriched categories of CSHGs in the above networks, TWIRLS separately constructed models for the complex relationships of each CSHG. We found that 45.53% of the All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This suggests that the biological mechanisms described by the C3 and C10 categories might be universally involved. Research on the entities, genes, pathways, and linker genes participating in the C3 and C10 categories could lead to new directions for the prevention, treatment, and clinical management of coronavirus infections. In this study, we used TWIRLS, a machine-based approach to collect, summarize, and analyze about 15,000 biomedical articles related to coronavirus, with the aim to elucidate the mechanisms underlying coronavirus-induced host pathological changes. Using TWIRLS, we found a possible mechanism involving ACE2/AT2R-RAS-Cytokine signaling, which becomes imbalanced under virus infection leading to cytokine storms. The TWIRLS system is an automated process that can summarize the entities and genes specifically related to coronaviruses. By combining this system with generalized interaction databases, we can reveal further associations that can provide a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms of the disease phenotype caused by virus-host interactions. virus to ACE2 may disrupt this balance, which causes a steady-state imbalance of RAS, leading to subsequent pathological changes. Although Ang II was originally described as an effective vasoconstrictor, there is growing evidence that it is closely involved in the inflammatory response of the immune system. Pro-inflammatory cytokines derived from immune cells normally regulate the RAS component, which further accelerates the formation of systemic and local Ang II [28] [29] [30] . In particular, pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate the production of AGT in the liver and kidney [31] [32] [33] . On the other hand, RAS has also been implicated in mediating the cytokine storm and has functional relationships with the immune system. Angiotensin II regulates vascular tension and stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [34, 35] . The production and release of CXC chemokines can induce the accumulation of neutrophils in vivo [36] . Meanwhile, ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers have been used in a number of cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathologies, and AT1R blockers (angiotensin receptor blocker) were shown to have beneficial effects that were commonly attributed to AT2R activation [37] . At the same time, it was reported that Ang II-stimulated human endothelial cells had increased release of a CXC chemokine, IP-10. The IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10 or CXCL10) is mainly expressed in the lung and is a chemoattractant for activated T cells. The expression of IP-10 has been observed in many Th1-type inflammatory diseases, where it is thought to play an important role in recruiting activated T cells to sites of tissue inflammation. Therefore, RAS dysfunction may result in the accumulation of cytokines, such as in the lungs leading to excessive accumulation of immune cells and interstitial fluid, blocking the airways and causing eventual death. As reported in the first severely infected patients diagnosed with COVID-19, a large number of patients experienced \"cytokine storms\" that was fatal [7] . Figure 6 summarizes the functional changes and pathological consequences of RAS system after ACE2 combines with the coronavirus. We expect the mechanism summarized and reasoned by TWIRLS can be further supported by pathological evidence. To date, only one report of a post-mortem biopsy has been published with pathological data.

The schematic representation of the overall study design is shown in Figure 1 and can be summarized in the following steps. The dataset used in this pipeline were from PubMed articles. First, PubMed was searched for articles including titles, abstracts, author and affiliation information containing the subject keyword \"coronavirus\". The search results were downloaded in txt format for compiling into structured information. The text in the subject abstract set was organized and cleaned, and then assigned to specific corpuses related to coronavirus (specific corpus) and compiled into the subject dictionary. To enhance the accuracy of the effective entities associated with the keyword, we used a random corpus for comparisons. We searched for article abstracts containing the keyword \"public health\" and compiled the abstract set into a random corpus, and then compiled them into a randomized control dictionary, which contains a wide range of proteins, genes, and related biological entities. We also considered a balanced amount of information by setting relevant parameters to adjust the amount of text before carrying out the statistical analyses. Biological entity identification is a key step in the literature mining process [7, 8] . To ensure functionality of the extracted entity, we first compared the entity from the subject dictionary with the human official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Nomenclature Commission (HGNC) database [9] to generate subject candidate genes using standard nomenclature. In addition, the entities in the abstract were capitalized to avoid errors in the identification process. To obtain widely used gene entities that are precisely related to the subject and to determine the significance of the gene distribution in the specific texts, we calculated the difference in the distribution proportions. We searched for the subject candidate genes in the subject dictionary and the randomized control dictionary, respectively. We also counted the number of abstracts containing each subject candidate gene in each abstract set, respectively. Finally, we calculated the odds ratio of each subject candidate gene and sorted them into a list of precisely related genes (CSHG). Similar to the process of identifying CSHG, we calculated whether entities were significantly distributed in a specific corpus. We counted the number of texts containing each CSHG in a specific corpus, and then counted the number of each candidate entity in the corpus subset. Next, we randomly selected the same amount of text from the random control corpus and then counted the number of each candidate entity in this subset of the random corpus. This was repeated 100-10000 times in the random corpus to generate candidate entities in the specified amount of text of the random distribution model. According to the central limit theorem (CLT), the distribution of random sampling averages of randomly distributed data always conforms to a normal distribution. Therefore, we can use the Z score to evaluate whether an entity is significant in a specific text. Here, we used a Z score cutoff value > 6. In addition, some entities have singular and plural noun forms, and synonyms with multiple forms in the abstracts. Therefore, we numbered the subject-related entity and automatically combined nouns with plural forms and homologous words with adjectives and adverb roots into the same entity, and then assigned them the same number.

Control of infectious bronchitis is hindered by the genetic diversity of the causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which has led to the emergence of several serotypes that lack complete serologic cross-protection. While serotyping by definition requires immunologic characterization, genotyping is an efficient means to identify IBVs detected in samples. Sanger sequencing of the S1 subunit of the spike gene is currently used to genotype IBV; however, the universal S1 PCR was created to work from cultured IBV and it is inefficient at detecting mixed isolates. This paper describes a MinION-based AmpSeq method that genetically typed IBV from clinical samples, including samples with multiple isolates. Total RNA was extracted from fifteen tracheal scrapings and choanal cleft swab samples, randomly reverse transcribed, and PCR amplified using modified S1-targeted primers. Amplicons were barcoded to allow for pooling of samples, processed per manufacturer's instructions into a 1D MinION sequencing library, and sequenced on the MinION. The AmpSeq method detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive samples. AmpSeq accurately detected and genotyped both IBV lineages in three of five samples containing two IBV lineages. Additionally, one sample contained three IBV lineages, and AmpSeq accurately detected two of the three. Strain identification, including detection of different strains from the same lineage, was also possible with this AmpSeq method. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using MinION-based AmpSeq for rapid and accurate identification and lineage typing of IBV from oral swab samples. Infectious bronchitis virus is an enveloped, pleomorphic gammacoronavirus with an unsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense, 26-27.8 Kb, RNA genome that encodes the nonstructural polyprotein,1a and 1b, and several structural proteins: spike (S), envelop (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). 38,41 In addition, two accessory genes, expressing 3a, 3b and 5a and 5b, respectively, have also been described. 6, 14, 38 The S protein is highly glycosylated and post-translational cleavage leads to two subunits: S1 and S2. 10,48 Besides acting as the viral attachment protein, the S1 protein is a major target of neutralizing antibodies. 7 As with many attachment proteins that are targets of virus-neutralizing antibodies, the S1 subunit is highly diverse with almost 50% of the amino acids differing among IBV serotypes. 2,21,38 Such variation leads to important biological differences between IBV serotypes and the emergence of novel variants. More than 60 serotypes of IBV have been reported, but the most common serotypes of All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. Massachusetts. 16 This genetic diversity leads to emergence of new serotypes and a lack of complete cross-serotype protection by vaccines. 29 The correlation of IBV genotypes and serotypes of IBV has been reported 45 ; therefore, accurate genotypic identification of IBV is an important step to diagnose IBV in clinical respiratory cases, ensure selection of proper IBV vaccines for use in vaccination programs, and to better understand the epidemiology of this global virus. One of the recent comprehensive classification schemes for IBV uses S1 gene sequencebased phylogeny of IBV and identified six genotypes (I-VI), 32 sub-genotypic lineages, and a number of inter-lineage recombinants in global strains of IBV. 44 Among the six genotypes, genotype I (G-I) is the most diverse group of viruses, with 27 unique lineages. 44 As such, sequencing of the S1 subunit provides important information regarding the classification of IBV within samples. The genetic classification of IBV has relied on genotype-specific RT-qPCR assays, serotype-specific S1 RT-qPCR 32,40 and/or pan-IBV S1 RT-PCR assays coupled with Sanger sequencing. 8,31,49 Genotype-specific RT-qPCRs are limited to short fragments, which may miss important changes in the S1 (~1.6 kb) 44 outside the short target. Additionally, since the target is short, the primers lie within the variable regions of the S1 and may require a different assay for each genotype. Lastly, the pan-IBV S1 primers 1, 17, 22, 23, 25, 33 , while only requiring one reaction, have relatively low sensitivity and are typically used only on egg-cultured virus, which adds an additional, time consuming step and many diagnostic labs do not have SPF embryos readily available. Lastly, cloning of PCR products has been used to detect multiple IBV sub-populations in the sample 30 ; however, this is inefficient when potentially dealing with multiple (three or four) All rights reserved.

As such, the development of a pan-IBV sequencing method to rapidly determine the genotype(s) in samples would aid in lineage typing and tracking of IBV genotypes circulating in poultry flocks. Recently, third generation sequencing technology has been used for detection of viral nucleotides and sequencing ultra-long DNA molecules. 34 The MinION Nanopore sequencer, a new DNA sequencing technology that allows for rapid, in-house, real-time technique detection and differentiation of IBV lineages, may be cost effective and useful in the field. 19 Ampliconbased sequencing has also been used to amplify specific regions of Newcastle disease 3,13 , infectious laryngotracheitis virus 39 Zika 34 , Ebola 35 and avian influenza viruses 46 , by simple RT-PCR and then sequencing on the MinION device. Real-time data analysis, the lack of significant start-up cost investment or maintenance expenses, simultaneous and sequential multiplexing unique to MinION, and the ability to sequence long DNA molecules so that primers are in conserved regions while the product contains the variable region are the features that make this technology highly feasible to be used for disease diagnostics. Accurate identification of IBV genotypes from samples, including detection of multiple isolates from a single sample, is crucial to respiratory disease diagnosis, selection of appropriate IBV vaccines, and epidemiologic studies. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to create a single, amplicon-based protocol to sequence IBV-S1 gene and develop a sequence analysis workflow to identify IBV isolates from clinical swab samples. This method provides a useful assay for IBV and a model for the development of future amplicon sequencing (AmpSeq) based assays. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. A universal S1 primer set, 27 tailed with the MinION universal adapter sequence of 22 nucleotides (underlined, Table 2 ) to allow barcoding of amplicons, was used for targeted amplification of the IBV S1 gene for IBV. The PCR reaction mixture (Expand High Fidelity PCR system, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was composed of 10 µl of cDNA, 1 µl of 10 µM forward primer, 1 µl of 10 µM reverse primer, 2.5 µl of 10× Expand high fidelity buffer, 1 µl of Expand High Fidelity Enzyme Mix, and 1 µl of 10mM dNTPs, to a final volume to 25 µl with 9 µl of nuclease-free water. The following thermocycling conditions were used for amplicon synthesis: denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 minutes, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. See Table 2 for details about all three primer sets used in this study. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen) for visual evaluation. Amplified DNA was purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) at 1.6:1 (volumetric bead:DNA) and quantified using the dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit on a Qubit® Fluorimeter 3.0. The amplicons obtained from the tailed S1 primer set were then used to prepare MinIONcompatible DNA libraries. Briefly, each of the amplicons were diluted to 0.5 nM and amplified using barcoding primers (1D PCR Barcoding Amplicon Kit, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, [ONT], UK) and LongAmp Taq 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) with the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min; 15 cycles of 95 °C for 15 seconds, 62 °C for 15 seconds, 65 °C for 80 seconds; and 65 °C for 80 seconds.

Centrifuge 24 , Kraken 50 , QIIME 5 and Mothur 37 have been used to identify and profile microbial species; however, the high error rate 20 of Nanopore reads translates to poor classification accuracy for many of these tools. Alternatively, de novo 3,26 or reference-based 18 assembly methods have been used in MinION and other deep sequencing platforms. Using a strategy similar to other unbiased laboratory tests (e.g., standard bacterial cultures), an approach was developed to maximize usage of reads (i.e., reads are not discarded based on pre-set length or abundance requirements, similar to how a single colony may be interpreted as a significant result). This approach uses read-based classification against a database containing an equal number of representative sequences per lineage to detect and classify the reads based on their lineage, before conducting read-based classification to the isolate level by using all available IBV sequences in a separate database. Finally, lineage-clustered isolate-level read assignments are interpreted by a veterinary diagnostician to result in reads available for consensus building. The use of a final consensus alignment helps to overcome the individual error rate of MinION sequencing. 3 Similarly, the absence of predetermined metrics used in de novo assembly allows for the informed decision as to how many consensus sequences to build, a bioinformatics problem when dealing with clinical cases that can contain more than one isolate (e.g., similar to how there is not a predetermined number of significant bacterial colonies). Confirmatory followup tests (e.g., RT-PCR) may be needed when dealing with low number of reads in clinical samples; however, future testing of this new technology will allow for creating standards for such confirmatory testing. Taken together, these results suggest the application of MinION-based AmpSeq, specifically for detecting IBV isolates from clinical samples within a few days, compared to several days to weeks and multiple diagnostic assays to culture and detect multiple IBV All rights reserved.

Detailed information about the samples is provided in Table 1 . Total RNA was extracted from each of the swab samples using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as per manufacturer's instructions, aliquoted, and stored at −80 ºC until further use. These samples were previously tested for IBV and GA08 serotype of IBV. Briefly, a pan IBV RT-qPCR assay 4 was used to detect IBV in general and then IBV strain specific RT-qPCR assay 36 was used to detect GA08 in the samples using the AgPath ID, One step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on the Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST following the previously described protocols. For MinION cDNA synthesis, RNA was extracted from 500 µl of each clinical sample using Trizol-LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), per manufacturer's directions. A reaction mixture of 8 µl of total RNA, 1 µl of random primers and 1 µl of dNTPs was incubated at 65 °C for 5 min, chilled on ice for at least 1 min followed by addition of 10 µl of cDNA synthesis mix including SuperScript III (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacture's instruction. The reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, then at 50 °C for 50 min for cDNA synthesis. The reaction was terminated at 85 °C for 5 min, and then chilled on ice. To remove residual RNA, the cDNA solution was incubated with RNase H at 37 °C for 20 min. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Sequencing was allowed to continue for 2 hours until 42,940 reads were obtained for Run1 and 156,000 reads were obtained for Run 2 in 6 hours. First, a lineage-typing database, containing 32 IBV S1 gene sequences (one sequence from each of 32 lineages in the 6 genotypes 44 ) and the chicken genome (GCF_000002315.4_Gallus_gallus-5.0), was constructed (referred to as \"IBV-lineage-typing database\" in this study). A second database was constructed with all the Avian Coronaviruses S1 sequences (n = 7328) available in NCBI (as of: 09-08-2017) and the chicken genome (referred to as \"All-IBV database\" in this study). Prior to database construction, all sequences were dustmasked (NCBI C++ ToolKit), and each isolate was assigned a unique taxonomy ID as a species hierarchically under the genus Gammacoronavirus to allow easy sorting. The local BLAST databases were compiled using default settings. The IBV-lineage-typing database was All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/634600 doi: bioRxiv preprint used to assign IBV lineages to each read, as appropriate. The All-IBV database was used to assign IBV isolates taxonomic ID to each of IBV reads from within IBV lineage read clusters. The IBV-lineage-typing database, which contains only one sequence per lineage, is required as centrifuge divides the score for any given read by the number of hits that have an equal score. Since some lineages are overrepresented in GenBank (e.g., Mass strains), this results in the scores of those reads (e.g., Mass reads) being divided by a large number, effectively reducing the score for any single alignment. However, because there is only one read per lineage in the IBVlineage-typing database, it has insufficient diversity to determine if there is more than one strain of the same lineage present in a sample. Thus, the All-IBV database provides the diversity required for that analysis. A schematic diagram of the workflow of MinION data analysis is presented in Fig. 1 . For Nanopore sequencing data, pre-processing steps were performed to prepare data for downstream analysis. Briefly, Nanopore reads (FAST5) were basecalled using Albacore v 2.02 (https://github.com/Albacore/albacore) with following parameters (read_fast5_basecaller.py -i /Input_reads.fast5 --recursive -t 4 -s /Output_files --flowcell FLO-MIN107 --kit SQK-LSK108o fastq). Porechop (https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) was used for adapter trimming, (default setting), barcode-based demultiplexing (default settings), and to trim an additional 21 nucleotides, representing the S1 primer sequences (porechop -i Input_file.fastq --extra_end_trim 21 -b ./output_demultiplexed files.fastq). After barcode and adapter removal, reads were analyzed with a script-based, 2-step data analysis protocol, which includes Centrifuge-kreport as taxonomic read classifier 24 using the sequences in the above mentioned BLAST databases. Briefly, basecalled reads (FASTQ) from individual barcoded samples were used as an input. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/634600 doi: bioRxiv preprint First, the basecalled reads were aligned to the IBV-lineage-typing database using BLASTn and reads were clustered based on the read sequence alignment to the respective prototype sequence of IBV lineage. These read clusters were used to interpret presence of IBV genotypes and lineages in the samples. For isolate level identification of IBV, the lineage-based read clusters were individually aligned to the All-IBV database, which produced sub-clusters of reads. Each of these read sub-clusters potentially represents a different isolate and was further used for interpretation. Knowing that MinION sequencing has a high sequencing error rate in individual reads, further steps were added in the data analysis algorithm to obtain a more accurate consensus sequence. Therefore, these read sub-clusters were mapped, using Geneious mapper in Geneious software v11.1.3. (Biomatters, Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand), to the IBV-lineagetyping database (a reference FASTA file) to obtain consensus sequences from each sub-cluster. A minimum threshold for number of reads per consensus sequence was not set as in two samples (sample #4 in Run1 and sample #12 in Run 2), only 1 and 5 IBV reads were obtained, respectively; therefore, consensus sequences were built from all the available IBV reads per subcluster. The consensus sequences were compared to GenBank using BLASTn. To select the \"top hit\" from BLASTn output, sequence search results were ordered by \"sequence identity\" and then sequence alignments were evaluated for \"minimum mismatches\" and \"coverage\" of query or subject sequence. All isolates with the highest query or subject coverage and the fewest mismatches were used as \"top hit\" in the final results. For Sanger sequencing amplicons synthesis, cDNA from MinION library preparation was amplified using the following primer sets (Table 2) . Firstly, a primer set based on Connecticut sequence NCBI FJ904716.1 was used to amplify Genotype I-lineage 1 viruses (e.g., Connecticut All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Secondly, a primer set based on GA98 sequence NCBI AF274439.1 was used to amplify Genotype IV-lineage 1 viruses (e.g., Georgia 1998 and Delaware 072 serotypes). Primer sets were designed using NCBI Primer-BLAST. 51 The PCR reaction mixture is composed of 10 µl of cDNA, 0.5 µl of 10 µM forward primer, 0.5 µl of 10 µM reverse primer, 2.5 µl of 10× buffer, 0.5 µl of enzyme mix, and 0.5 µl of 10mM dNTPs, then made the final volume to 25 µl with nuclease-free water. The following thermocycling conditions were used for amplicon synthesis: denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, followed by  For Sanger sequencing data, the chromatogram from each of the samples was manually checked and primer sequences were trimmed in MEGA 6.0. 42 Forward and reverse sequences from multiple clones were aligned using MEGA 6.0 software and consensus sequences were All rights reserved.

A pairwise nucleotide identity comparison on the partial S1 sequences of IBVs from each of the samples sequenced with Sanger sequencing and MinION sequencing was performed. Briefly, the final AmpSeq consensus sequences from identical IBV types in each of the sample were aligned using ClustalW in MEGA6 42 and this alignment was used for pairwise nucleotide identity using MEGA6. 42 All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/634600 doi: bioRxiv preprint Five samples from Run 1 were tested with a pan-IBV RT-qPCR assay 4 , and four of those were positive for IBV. Samples with pathogenic IBV strains (Run 2, n = 5) were tested with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR and all five samples were IBV positive (Table 1) . Next, a GA08 serotype specific primer set (in house validated set of primers used for diagnostics) was used on all samples from Run 1 (including five samples that were previously tested by the pan-IBV PCR) and four of 10 samples were positive. Sample #3 and #4, which were positive with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR assay, were negative with GA08 specific RT-qPCR assay indicating that these samples contained IBV serotypes other than GA08 and required further testing. Sample #5 tested negative with both assays (Table 1) . A total of 10 clinical swab samples (Run 1) were processed for Sanger sequencing to confirm the presence of IBV lineages. Based on the MinION results, primers targeting GIV-L1 and GI-L1 (GA98 and Conn and primer sets, respectively) were created. The PCR products were cloned and multiple (6-24) clones from each sample were submitted for Sanger sequencing and results are summarized in Table 3 . Using GIV-L1 serotype primers showed that 9 out of 10 samples were positive with 1 sample (#5) negative for IBV (which is consistent with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR results for this sample). Consensus sequences from multiple clones obtained by using GIV-L1 primers showed the presence of GA98 (GA/A9dvaccinated) in 7 of 9 IBV-positive samples. DE072 was detected in samples #1 and #9 as the lone GIV-1 isolate but was also detected in three samples (#2, and #10) that also contained GA98 (Table 4 ). By using the GI-L1 primer set, which amplified Conn and Mass type IBVs, 3 of 9 IBV-positive samples were All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. (Table 4 ). Based on the two conventional RT-PCRs and the GA08 RT-qPCR, it was determined that only samples #8 and #9 contained a single IBV isolate, while the other 7 samples were positive for 2-4 types of IBV (Table 3) . PCR amplicons obtained directly from 10 clinical swab samples with vaccine IBV serotypes were barcoded, pooled together and sequenced on MinION device (Run 1). A total of 38,661 reads were successfully basecalled from the entire sequencing run (total reads = 42,940). After demultiplexing, reads per barcode ranged from 831 to 4114. A total of 14,845 reads were not assigned to any of the used barcodes and 128 reads were discarded due to middle adapters. The Nanopore reads were queried against IBV-lineage-typing database to determine if the samples contained IBV (Figure 1 ). This AmpSeq protocol detected IBV reads in 8 of 10 samples. The number of IBV reads per sample (IBV positive sample) ranged from 56-944. The MinIONnegative samples included sample #5, which was consistently negative with RT-qPCR and RT-PCR assays (and thus interpreted as IBV negative), and sample #1, which had the highest Cq values in the pan-IBV RT-qPCR (Table 1) . Sequencing data was further analyzed to determine if multiple IBV genotypes or lineages could be detected. Lineage-1 and lineage-27 from Genotype I (GI-L1, GI-L27), and lineage-1 from Genotype IV (GIV-L1) were the detected lineages in the samples. Results from individual RT-qPCR assay for GA08 (GI-L27), and RT-PCR assays for GIV-L1and GI-L1 confirmed the presence of multiple IBV genotypes and lineages in 6 of the 9 IBV-positive samples (#1, #2, #3, #4, #6, #7) and AmpSeq results confirmed multiple genotypes and lineages in 4 (#2, #4, #6, #7) of those 6 samples (AmpSeq failed to detect any IBV in #1, and failed to detect GIV-L1 in #3).

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/634600 doi: bioRxiv preprint The presence of a single lineage was confirmed by PCR-based assays and AmpSeq in three samples (#8, # 9 and #10) ( Table 3) . It was observed that the single read cluster composed of less than 5 reads (Run1, sample #4, GA98) yielded a poor-quality consensus sequence, consistent with the known individual read error rate of MinION sequencing. High-quality consensus sequences were obtained from the other read clusters (>5 reads per cluster). Each of the obtained consensus sequences were compared to GenBank databases using BLAST, which revealed >99% sequence identity to respective IBV isolates Table 4 ). As described in the Sanger Sequencing section, two samples (#8 and #9) contained only one IBV isolate per the non-MinION assays, and the AmpSeq results were consistent with these findings. Non-MinION assays showed that seven samples contained two or more isolates per sample. Six samples (#1, #3, #4, #6, #7, and #10) contained two isolates per sample (Table 4 ). Of those six samples, AmpSeq detected both isolates in four samples (#4, #6, #7, and #10), one isolate in one sample (#3), and no IBV in one sample (#1; as mentioned above, sample #1 was the sample with the highest Cq value). Of note, sample #10 contained two isolates from the same lineage and AmpSeq was able to identify both isolates within this sample. Finally, the seventh multi-isolate sample (#2) contained four isolates per the non-MinION results, and the AmpSeq detected two of those four isolates. These data show that a co-infection of multiple IBV lineages existed in the above-mentioned samples but a single RT-qPCR, or Sanger sequencing of a single clone may not have detected these co-infecting IBV lineages and required multiple assays to detect all the IBV types. However, the AmpSeq protocol accurately detected multiple IBV lineages in 4 of 7 samples, with partial detection in two of the remaining three samples (Table 4 ).

To evaluate the utility of this protocol on clinical swab samples with pathogenic IBV variants, IBV-S1 gene was amplified directly from five clinical tracheal scrapings and the PCR amplicons were used to create MinION libraries. A total of 146,540 reads were successfully basecalled from the entire sequencing run (total reads = 156,000). After demultiplexing, reads per barcode ranged from 4,285 to 41,131. A total of 24,297 reads were not assigned to any of the used barcodes and 8,109 reads were discarded due to middle adapters in the basecalled reads. Real-time analysis of MinION data, which was obtained within 10 minutes of the sequencing, was sufficient for detection of IBV. However, the sequencing data obtained from entire sequencing run was processed with the same protocol as described above. This AmpSeq protocol detected IBV reads in all of the 5 tested samples using all basecalled reads. The number of IBV reads per sample ranged from 5-4,956. Additionally, the sequencing data analysis showed that the IBV reads belonged to GI-17 lineage and typed the isolate as DMV1639. After MinION sequencing results, these samples were later tested to confirm the presence of IBV variant by MDL_DMV1639 IBV variant specific RT-qPCR assay. All 5 samples were positive for IBV MDL_DMV1639 variant of IBV (Table 5) .

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/634600 doi: bioRxiv preprint This study describes a sequencing approach for rapid and accurate identification of IBV genotypes/lineages utilizing the MinION Nanopore sequencer. Additionally, a sequence analysis workflow is described here. The workflow analysis is designed to deal with the multiple, highly similar sequences contained within GenBank that are due to numerous sequencing experiments of IBV (especially vaccine viruses). This protocol demonstrates the feasibility of real-time-based sequencing to provide isolate-level resolution of IBV directly from clinical swab samples, including samples that contain multiple isolates. The proper diagnosis of IBV as the cause of clinical respiratory disease is contingent on virus typing and differentiating live vaccine viruses from field strains. 11 Previously, it was reported that IBV genotypes correlate well with the serotypes of IBV 45 ; therefore, accurate genotypic identification of IBV will be useful to diagnose vaccine and variant viruses in clinical samples. The rapid pan-IBV and serotype specific RT-qPCR assays 4,23,36 have been used for serotype identification; however, positive results from RT-qPCR is insufficient to determine the IBV genotype and obtain isolate-level resolution of IBV; thus, sequence analysis of IBV-S1 gene is required. Previously, use of partial S1 gene sequences (450 bp) to type IBV has been described. 29 However, increasing the length of sequenced S1 gene (~1620 bp) results in more data to be used for genotyping as more of the hypervariable region is covered. 17, 27, 45 For example, the AmpSeq protocol was able to differentiate two genetically very similar (99.5% at S1 gene of IBV genome) but serotypically different GIV-L1 isolates, DE072 and GA98, within a single sample. Thus, the detection of highly diverse IBV genotypes, via the S1 subunit, with a single and rapid sequencing protocol is desirable and the ability to detect multiple isolates in a single sample would improve IBV detection in clinical samples.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/634600 doi: bioRxiv preprint Currently, pan-IBV RT-qPCR is used to rapidly detect IBV from clinical samples for screening purposes, 4 but this requires additional serotype-specific RT-qPCRs to genotype positive samples, including samples containing more than one genotype. Additionally, if unidentified IBVs are in the sample, then current detection and characterization may also require egg culture followed by various PCRs. 8 The AmpSeq method described in this report detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive and detected all the mixed isolates in four of seven samples containing two or more isolates. While mixed isolates were not 100% identified (0/2 in #1, 2/4 in #2, and ½ in #3) in three samples with the AmpSeq method, detection of those mixed isolates required several non-AmpSeq assays. Although, there is room for improving this new AmpSeq method, it represents a promising, single-step assay that can be used without egg culture. Thus, it is another tool for the detection of IBV, especially in cases when multiple isolates may be present or when genotyping is especially important. One area that is problematic for a test such as AmpSeq is to detect all the isolates that may be present. While AmpSeq did detect all isolates in 4 samples, in 3 cases not all of the isolates were detected. A potential explanation to partial detection of multiple IBV genotypes could be the relative abundance of IBV genotypes in these clinical samples. It could also be that amplification of these IBV genotypes by serotype-specific RT-qPCR assays is more efficient due to small targeted fragment size (e.g., 120 bp for PCR and ~1600 bp for AmpSeq) and better primer alignment to the target (e.g., degenerate bases are used in the S1 primers used for AmpSeq). One complicating factor of the current AmpSeq protocol is that the IBV target sequence 27 was not originally designed for high specificity, especially from clinical samples. As such, a high proportion of total reads were non-IBV reads (e.g., often mapping to the chicken genome, data not shown), consistent with the extra bands visible in the original report for these All rights reserved.

Lastly, increasing the total number of reads collected by AmpSeq may improve the ability to detect all genotypes in sample by AmpSeq. It is possible to allow the sequencing to continue longer to obtain more reads per sample. Overall, AmpSeq is a feasible test for IBV characterization, and work is ongoing to improve this new type of assay. For example, cost and time efficiency of a sequencing protocol can be improved through multiplexing of more samples in a single sequencing run. 3, 47 In this study, samples (Run 1 = 10, Run 2 = 5) were simultaneously multiplexed (i.e., pooled and then sequenced in one run) while maintaining IBV genotyping from data collected. Since the MinION flow cells were not exhausted, and can be washed and re-used, the AmpSeq method also has the potential for sequential multiplexing. This would decrease the need to hold samples for weeks while waiting for the cost-optimal number of samples for simultaneous multiplexing. Alternatively, if detection of all isolates within a given sample is preferred, the sequencing can be run longer to increase sensitivity. The single protocol nature of AmpSeq, the ability to obtain S1 gene sequence results, real-time data analysis, and flexibility of testing design makes MinION-based AmpSeq a viable sequencing protocol for typing of IBV isolates. The advent of real-time, in-house, third generation sequencing represents a transformative opportunity for diagnostic laboratories, by offering the ability to more fully characterize PCR reactions beyond confirming amplicon size (e.g., routine electrophoresis), Sanger sequencing RT-PCR products, or by confirming a partial sequence through probe hybridization (e.g., probe-based qPCR). However, the interpretation of such large data sets represents a challenge to veterinary diagnosticians. Read-based classification software such as genotypes from single sample. Thus, the MinION-based AmpSeq coupled with the data analysis workflow for identification, differentiation, and accurate prediction of IBV genotypes from clinical swab samples can be used as an adjunct to other established rapid diagnostic assays 9,12 until extensive testing of this protocol is done to improve and validate AmpSeq for IBV diagnostics. Furthermore, AmpSeq-based assays can be, and are being applied to other viral pathogens, 3,37 demonstrating the power and utility of this method in the age of molecular diagnostics.
