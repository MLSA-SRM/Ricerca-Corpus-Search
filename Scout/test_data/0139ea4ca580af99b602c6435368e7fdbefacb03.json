In order to prioritize these inhibitors, we performed several tests and applied filters to identify drug-like non-toxic compounds. Of 98, a few compounds passed DruLito & PAINS filters exhibiting drug-like properties and were also prioritized in an independent screen based only the assay robustness. The NVIs have diverse structural features and offer a wide spectrum of ways in which they can be developed further as druglike molecules.",

It was traced back to cross-species transmission of the virus from pigs to humans [4, 5] . In 2001 another strain of the virus was reported to cause an outbreak in Meherpur, Bangladesh. Since then outbreaks have been recorded almost annually in the country and surrounding regions such as Siliguri, India [6, 7] . Most of the outbreaks have been observed to have a mortality rate ranging from 50-100% [8] . Although direct contact with the infected bat's contaminants could cause transmission of the virus, direct human-to-human transmission has also been observed in the case of healthcare professionals and relatives of infected patients [9, 10] . More recently, the virus has garnered attention due to the first-ever outbreak in southern India during May of 2018 where 19 cases of NiV were reported in Kozhikode, Kerala. In the subsequent year, 2019, another case was reported in Ernakulam district of the state [11, 12] .",

Favipiravir (T-705), a purine analogue antiviral, is reported to provide protection to upto 14 days in the Syrian hamster model challenged with a lethal dose of Nipah virus [20] . More recently, experimental drug remdesivir has demonstrated complete protection to four African green monkeys who received a lethal dose of Nipah virus. Studies are planned to assess the efficacy of the treatment over time [21] . Despite being a lethal pathogen there is not a single drug under clinical trial against this virus. Due to several challenges in discovery and development of NVIs, along with lack of therapeutic intervention and the pathogenic propensity of the virus, Nipah infections are enlisted amongst WHO's list of priority diseases [22] .",

Most of them have used syncytia formation or titre reduction assays to identify Nipah virus inhibitors. Some of the earlier studies report nipah inhibitors based on screening of large libraries within BSL-4 settings to identify compounds that inhibited the virus-induced cytopathic effect. Three sulfonamide compounds with low EC50 values are reported [23] from these screens. More recently, Bimolecular Multicellular Complementation assays have been developed which can be used to identify potential anti-nipah inhibitors by qualitatively and quantitatively investigating the formation of a syncytium [24] . Also reported recently is a humanized monoclonal antibody for cross-neutralizing NiV and HeV. Cryo-electron microscopy followed by fusion studies demonstrated that the antibody binds to a prefusion-specific quaternary epitope which is conserved in NiV F and HeV F glycoproteins. The binding prevents membrane fusion and viral entry and clearly indicates the importance of the HNV prefusion F conformation for eliciting a robust immune response [25] .",

The drug likeness analysis includes diversity analysis, similarity to FDA approved compounds (as drug repurposing candidates) or reported antivirals (to identify new scaffolds), profiling based on PAINS and DruLito filters and comparison to ZINC lead like libraries.

Based on this analysis, we prioritised 11 NVIs. Further analysis of these NVIs also indicated that they have physicochemical descriptor values which are closer to existing drug like FDA approved compounds. Our analysis of FDA approved compounds for several physicochemical parameters namely molecular weight, number of hydrogen bond donors, number of hydrogen bond acceptors, number of rotatable bonds, XlogP and topological polar surface area revealed that most prioritized NVIs have drug like features. As can be seen from Table 2 exhibits better activity among the three and has considerable overlap with the physicochemical properties of FDA approved drugs. The scope of the current study was to perform a systematic evaluation of physicochemical properties of NVIs with respect to FDA approved drugs and antiviral libraries, understand the diversity of chemical scaffolds and correlate these computed properties with the experimentally reported bioactivity datasets for proposing a list of prioritized candidates. In order to simplify data access and further enhancement of data libraries, a web-based platform is designed for reporting new compounds, further analysis and prioritization of potential NVIs.",
