We obtained text data (called local samples) from all related articles on the coronavirus that had been peer reviewed and published by human experts, which included the title, abstracts, author and affiliation information (total 3,182,687 words). The goal of the literature mining was to identify host genes and entities that are relevant to coronavirus research and to establish connections between them. An entity can refers to a word or phrase of the concept name (including related concepts, e.g., virus structure and chemical composition, source of infection, and virus type). The gene names were defined using the mammalian official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Naming Committee (HGNC) database. We directly retrieved 667 candidate genes from the local samples. By establishing a random distribution of one of the candidate genes in a control sample, the significance of this gene appearing in the local samples can be determined when the frequency of the current gene is an outlier of the random distribution of the control samples (see Methods for details). By calculating the odds ratio, we can also further determine the specificity of the association between this gene and the local samples. In this paper, we selected an odds ratio > 6 as the threshold for this judgment, which resulted in 123 coronavirus study-specific host genes (CSHGs).",

We removed numbers, symbols, verbs, and garbled characters to obtain clean versions of the local samples. The coronavirus study-specific entities (CSSE) were then identified in only the clean texts containing CSHGs. Based on the clean selected samples, we next built a local dictionary of candidate CSSEs containing 49,293 words after deduplication. Before calculating the random distribution of each entity, we included the synonymous entities into a same entity number (including singular or plural words, active and passive forms, different tenses, suffixes that do not change the meaning, etc.). For example, synonymous entities such as coronaviral, coronavirus, coronaviruses were grouped into one entity as coronavirus and assigned the same number (see entity number in Table S1 , Sheet 1 first column). The previous method of merging synonymous entities was based on a dictionary [9, 10] , which not only relied on the integrity of the dictionary, but also required a long retrieval time. To automatically solve the synonymous entity problem, TWIRLS classifies similar strings based on whether there is a significant statistical association between the character blocks in a set of candidate entities including various synonymous entities (see Methods). After cleaning and processing, CSSEs were identified by TWIRLS using a similar method to that for CSHG as described above.",

As each category contains different entities, we can determine whether a certain CSHG is significantly closer to each entity in the current category based on the ranking matrix between CSHG and CSSE. For example, the average distance between ACE2 and the 92 entities in category C5 is first calculated, then a random distribution model of the average distance between ACE2 and any of the 92 entities (3000-5000 times) is built, and finally, we determine if the average distance between ACE2 and entities in category C5 is significantly less than and deviates from the mean of the random distribution (Z score = -5.8416). The significance of each category associated with each CSHG is then scored by TWIRLS ranging between -10 and +10, with a smaller score indicating the current CSHG is more relevant to the current category (see the Z-score matrix in Table S1 , sheet 2). For an entity category, the associated CSHGs (e.g., Ci CSHGs, where i represents the category number) can thus be selected by a Z score <-3 (the Z scores describing the association between CSHG and any category is summarized in Sheet2 of Table S1 , and the category labels of all CSHGs are provided in Sheet 3).",

We extended the 119 CSHGs to their 2 o networks based on the interactions with higher likelihood of connections (Combined score> 800). The 2 o networks expanded the number of genes from 119 host genes to 3,494 genes that may be associated with coronavirus (see Table S1 , Sheet 6 with DPP4 [12] . The different distribution of these receptors in the respiratory tract results in different degrees of infection. Although the infection ability of MERS is lower than in SARS, the mortality is higher (in about one-third of patients) because of the deeper infection site [13] . Similar to the SARS virus, viral genomics and structural biology studies have shown that ACE2 is also a functional receptor for the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. After binding to ACE2 via its Spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes membrane fusion and enters the host cells by endocytosis. The ACE2 peptidase is a key regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS). It is highly expressed in the heart, kidney, and testis, and is also expressed at lower levels in other tissues (mainly in the intestine and lungs) [14, 15] . Recent studies have shown that the binding of the S protein to ACE2 in the new coronavirus is 10 to 20 times stronger than in the SARS virus [16] , which may help the new coronavirus infect the host through the upper respiratory tract, significantly increasing its infectivity. Using TWIRLS, we were able to identify both ACE2 and DPP4 genes as CSHGs, and both were significantly associated with the C5 category. The HR label for this category is \"associated with S protein.\"",

Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a serine protease that hydrolyzes and activates the spike glycoproteins of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC), Sendai virus (SeV) and human interstitial pneumovirus (HMPV), and 1,2,3 fusion glycoproteins of F0, 4a, and 4b human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) [17, 18] . The function of this gene is essential for the transmission and pathogenesis of influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2 and H7N9 strains). It is also involved in the hydrolysis and activation of hemagglutinin proteins, which are essential for viral infectivity [19, 20] . Although entities in the C5 category and in the cited literature mainly show that virus invasion is facilitated by virus-binding receptors and membrane proteases, the biological mechanism of the receptor binding to viruses leading to pathological changes has been reported less frequently.

Using TWIRLS, we found a possible mechanism involving ACE2/AT2R-RAS-Cytokine signaling, which becomes imbalanced under virus infection leading to cytokine storms. The TWIRLS system is an automated process that can summarize the entities and genes specifically related to coronaviruses. By combining this system with generalized interaction databases, we can reveal further associations that can provide a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms of the disease phenotype caused by virus-host interactions.",

In particular, pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate the production of AGT in the liver and kidney [31] [32] [33] . On the other hand, RAS has also been implicated in mediating the cytokine storm and has functional relationships with the immune system. Angiotensin II regulates vascular tension and stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [34, 35] . The production and release of CXC chemokines can induce the accumulation of neutrophils in vivo [36] . Meanwhile, ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers have been used in a number of cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathologies, and AT1R blockers (angiotensin receptor blocker) were shown to have beneficial effects that were commonly attributed to AT2R activation [37] . At the same time, it was reported that Ang II-stimulated human endothelial cells had increased release of a CXC chemokine, IP-10. The IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein 10 (IP-10 or CXCL10) is mainly expressed in the lung and is a chemoattractant for activated T cells. The expression of IP-10 has been observed in many Th1-type inflammatory diseases, where it is thought to play an important role in recruiting activated T cells to sites of tissue inflammation. Therefore, RAS dysfunction may result in the accumulation of cytokines, such as in the lungs leading to excessive accumulation of immune cells and interstitial fluid, blocking the airways and causing eventual death. As reported in the first severely infected patients diagnosed with COVID-19, a large number of patients experienced \"cytokine storms\" that was fatal [7] . Figure 6 summarizes the functional changes and pathological consequences of RAS system after ACE2 combines with the coronavirus.",
