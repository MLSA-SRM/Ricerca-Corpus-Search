            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) causes significant economic losses in the global poultry industry. Control of infectious bronchitis is hindered by the genetic diversity of the causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which has led to the emergence of several serotypes that lack complete serologic cross-protection. While serotyping by definition requires immunologic characterization, genotyping is an efficient means to identify IBVs detected in samples. Sanger sequencing of the S1 subunit of the spike gene is currently used to genotype IBV; however, the universal S1 PCR was created to work from cultured IBV and it is inefficient at detecting mixed isolates. This paper describes a MinION-based AmpSeq method that genetically typed IBV from clinical samples, including samples with multiple isolates. Total RNA was extracted from fifteen tracheal scrapings and choanal cleft swab samples, randomly reverse transcribed, and PCR amplified using modified S1-targeted primers. Amplicons were barcoded to allow for pooling of samples, processed per manufacturer's instructions into a 1D MinION sequencing library, and sequenced on the MinION. The AmpSeq method detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive samples.",

The results demonstrate the feasibility of using MinION-based AmpSeq for rapid and accurate identification and lineage typing of IBV from oral swab samples.",

Alternatively, de novo 3,26 or reference-based 18 assembly methods have been used in MinION and other deep sequencing platforms. Using a strategy similar to other unbiased laboratory tests (e.g., standard bacterial cultures), an approach was developed to maximize usage of reads (i.e., reads are not discarded based on pre-set length or abundance requirements, similar to how a single colony may be interpreted as a significant result). This approach uses read-based classification against a database containing an equal number of representative sequences per lineage to detect and classify the reads based on their lineage, before conducting read-based classification to the isolate level by using all available IBV sequences in a separate database. Finally, lineage-clustered isolate-level read assignments are interpreted by a veterinary diagnostician to result in reads available for consensus building.",

The rapid pan-IBV and serotype specific RT-qPCR assays 4,23,36 have been used for serotype identification; however, positive results from RT-qPCR is insufficient to determine the IBV genotype and obtain isolate-level resolution of IBV; thus, sequence analysis of IBV-S1 gene is required. Previously, use of partial S1 gene sequences (450 bp) to type IBV has been described. 29 However, increasing the length of sequenced S1 gene (~1620 bp) results in more data to be used for genotyping as more of the hypervariable region is covered. 17, 27, 45 For example, the AmpSeq protocol was able to differentiate two genetically very similar (99.5% at S1 gene of IBV genome) but serotypically different GIV-L1 isolates, DE072 and GA98, within a single sample. Thus, the detection of highly diverse IBV genotypes, via the S1 subunit, with a single and rapid sequencing protocol is desirable and the ability to detect multiple isolates in a single sample would improve IBV detection in clinical samples.

Additionally, if unidentified IBVs are in the sample, then current detection and characterization may also require egg culture followed by various PCRs. 8 The AmpSeq method described in this report detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive and detected all the mixed isolates in four of seven samples containing two or more isolates.

While AmpSeq did detect all isolates in 4 samples, in 3 cases not all of the isolates were detected. A potential explanation to partial detection of multiple IBV genotypes could be the relative abundance of IBV genotypes in these clinical samples. It could also be that amplification of these IBV genotypes by serotype-specific RT-qPCR assays is more efficient due to small targeted fragment size (e.g., 120 bp for PCR and ~1600 bp for AmpSeq) and better primer alignment to the target (e.g., degenerate bases are used in the S1 primers used for AmpSeq). One complicating factor of the current AmpSeq protocol is that the IBV target sequence 27 was not originally designed for high specificity, especially from clinical samples. As such, a high proportion of total reads were non-IBV reads (e.g., often mapping to the chicken genome, data not shown), consistent with the extra bands visible in the original report for these All rights reserved.

Lastly, increasing the total number of reads collected by AmpSeq may improve the ability to detect all genotypes in sample by AmpSeq. It is possible to allow the sequencing to continue longer to obtain more reads per sample. Overall, AmpSeq is a feasible test for IBV characterization, and work is ongoing to improve this new type of assay.",

Since the MinION flow cells were not exhausted, and can be washed and re-used, the AmpSeq method also has the potential for sequential multiplexing. This would decrease the need to hold samples for weeks while waiting for the cost-optimal number of samples for simultaneous multiplexing. Alternatively, if detection of all isolates within a given sample is preferred, the sequencing can be run longer to increase sensitivity. The single protocol nature of AmpSeq, the ability to obtain S1 gene sequence results, real-time data analysis, and flexibility of testing design makes MinION-based AmpSeq a viable sequencing protocol for typing of IBV isolates.",

However, the interpretation of such large data sets represents a challenge to veterinary diagnosticians. Read-based classification software such as genotypes from single sample. Thus, the MinION-based AmpSeq coupled with the data analysis workflow for identification, differentiation, and accurate prediction of IBV genotypes from clinical swab samples can be used as an adjunct to other established rapid diagnostic assays 9,12 until extensive testing of this protocol is done to improve and validate AmpSeq for IBV diagnostics. Furthermore, AmpSeq-based assays can be, and are being applied to other viral pathogens, 3,37 demonstrating the power and utility of this method in the age of molecular diagnostics.

PCR products were visually inspected after electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gel and the correctly sized bands were cut out for cDNA purification using QIAGEN PCR Purification Kit and quantified using the dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit on a Qubit\u00ae Fluorimeter 3.0. Briefly, purified amplicons were inserted into plasmids and ligation reactions (10 \u00b5l) were set up as per manufacturer's instructions (Promega pGEM-T Easy vector system). After ligation, 3 \u00b5l of ligation mixture was transformed to JM109 competent cells by heat shock. Individual bacterial colonies were checked with PCR and the positive bacterial colonies were plated on LB-agar/ampicillin plates at 37\u00b0C for 16 hr. The plasmids were extracted from these positive bacterial colonies (QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and submitted for bidirectional, commercial (GENEWIZ, NJ, USA) Sanger sequencing.",

Final DNA libraries were bead purified (0.4:1; bead:solution), eluted in 15 \u00b5L and sequenced with the MinION Nanopore sequencer. A new FLO-MIN106 R9.4 flow cell (ONT), stored at 4\u00b0C prior to use, was allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 10 minutes and then primed with running buffer as per manufacturer's instructions. The pooled DNA libraries were prepared by combining 12 \u00b5L of the library pool with 2.5 \u00b5L nuclease-free water, 35 \u00b5L RBF, and 25.5 \u00b5L library loading beads.
