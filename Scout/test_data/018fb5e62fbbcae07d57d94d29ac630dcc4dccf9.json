            "text": "Recent events highlight how emerging and re-emerging pathogens are actually becoming global challenges for public health. [1] Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses which are broadly distributed either in humans or in a vast majority of other mammals and birds. These viruses have the possibility to cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases. [2, 3] Coronaviruses are highly prevalent in many species. They have a large genetic diversity. Given their RNA, they are susceptible to frequent recombination and mutations of their genomes. In context in which there are increasing human-animal interactions, novel coronaviruses are very likely to emerge periodically. If the newly created cross-species pathogens acquires the ability to infect humans or to be transmitted human to human it can lead to occasional spillover events and epidemics. [4, 5, 6] In the past years two other strains of Coronavirus -severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -have emerged as potential public health worldwide threats. [5] SARS-CoV was the causal agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in 2002 and 2003 in Guangdong Province, China; [7, 8, 9] MERS-CoV was the pathogen responsible for severe respiratory disease outbreaks in 2012 in the Middle East. [10] On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology detected in Wuhan City, located in the Hubei Province, China, associated with exposures in a seafood and wet wholesale market in the same city. A new type of coronavirus was isolated on 7 January 2020. [11] On 30 January 2020 WHO declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). [12] This novel coronavirus suddenly turned out to be a global health concern for a disease, called Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), [13] which was characterized as a pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020. [14] Starting from the second-half of January 2020, scientific literature has been particularly focused on the description of this new viral outbreak; the main topics addressed were the epidemiological, clinical and virological aspects as well as the possible public health choices necessary to contain the spread of the disease. Nevertheless, several aspects are still unclear and have not been thoroughly explored, leaving grey areas in our knowledge of the disease and of the outbreak. The aim of this paper is to perform a bibliometric analysis on the first papers published in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, in order to give a glimpse to the researchers of \"who published what\" at the very beginning of this Public Health Emergency of International Concern.",

[15] [Supplementary materials, Table 1 , ID: 1] We subsequently extended our research to the first 30 days after this milestone article, up to 13 January 2020. We decided to scan the reference lists of the reviews retrieved in order to find potential additional pertinent articles, and to test string sensitivity. The search string used was: coronavirus* OR Pneumonia of Unknown Etiology OR COVID-19 OR nCoV. The virus name was updated from \"2019-nCoV\" to \"SARS-CoV-2\" by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February 2020, [16] yet we performed the search using the term \"nCoV\" since we presumed that no paper published between 11 February 2020 and 13 February 2020 would have used the term \"SARS-COV-2\". To achieve the highest sensitivity, we decided to use only a combination of keywords avoiding Mesh terms. Asterisks are used to truncate words, so that every ending after the asterisks was searched. We placed a language restriction for English, without other limits to the search.",

This paper emphasized the need for countries to put in place strong measures in order to detect and laboratory-confirm cases early. It was also highlighted the need to perform molecular testing (RT-PCR, as also indicated by the WHO [19] ) on different specimens including: nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage, oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, sputum, (endo) tracheal aspirate and nasal wash. The communication report also underlined the need for a clinical validation of the test specificity and sensitivity. If nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are the recommended types of specimen for diagnostic testing an interesting brief report published by Chinese authors [20] [Supplementary materials 165, 167, 197, 222] were published in the second half of the time frame selected, mostly by authors with a Chinese affiliation. These papers addressed several aspects of COVID-19 treatment, such as interferon inhalation, use of and efficacy of antiviral drugs, potential repurposing treatments with angiotensin receptor blockers, use of antibiotics for bacterial co-infections, and respiratory support therapy (e.g. oxygen saturation, CPAP, invasive mechanical ventilation). Interestingly, one paper published on 4 February 2020 [21] [Supplementary materials, Table 1 , ID: 91] investigated the possibility that the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect lung cells might be ACE2, a cell-surface protein on lung AT2 alveolar epithelial cells; one of the known regulators of endocytosis for the AT2 cells is the AP2associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1). The authors suggested the possibility to use high-affinity AAK1-binding drugs to inhibit endocytosis of AT2 cells, such as baricitinib (an oral, targeted All rights reserved.

The reason for this distribution is ascribed to the fact that China is the country where the virus was originally isolated and the first one with a COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, we have to point out that, as shown in a commentary published in Nature, in recent years China produced more science PhD than any other country in the world and the Chinese government has been assuming a leading role in supporting its own scientific research.",

Nevertheless, papers excluded which were written in Chinese and had an English abstract, were for the greatest part reports of the Chinese Government (data not shown).
