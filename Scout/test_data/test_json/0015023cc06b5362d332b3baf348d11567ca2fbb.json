Abstract 27 The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses comprise a single large open reading 28 frame flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs). Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 29 has an unusually large 5\u2032 UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the 30 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting 31 replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5\u2032 terminal 360 nucleotide 32 stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of 33 two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs 34 by selective 2\u2032 hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and 35 determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. 36 SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK 37 structures for their function. Deletion experiments showed that although PKs are not essential 38",

The 5\u2032 UTR of FMDV is unique amongst picornaviruses due to its large size and the presence 454 of multiple RNA elements, some of which still have unknown function. One of these features 455 is a series of repeated PKs varying in number from 2-4, depending on virus strain. In this study, 456 we sequentially deleted or mutated the PKs to help understand their role in the viral life cycle. 457 We also confirmed the predicted PK structures by SHAPE mapping, although there may be Although all viruses isolated to date contain at least two PKs, replicons or viruses containing a 464 single PK were still replication competent. However, replicons with more than a single PK 465 were found to have a competitive advantage over replicons with a single PK when sequentially 466 passaged. Replicons lacking all PKs displayed poor passaging potential even when co-467 transfected with yeast tRNA, reinforcing the observation of a significant impact in replication.",

This also supports 474 our findings that the truncation of the Poly-C-tract to create the C11 construct had no effect on 475 replicon replication in the cell lines tested.

            "text": "and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a single stranded positive sense RNA virus of the 45 genus Aphthovirus in the family Picornaviridae. It occurs as seven, antigenically diverse 46 serotypes; A, O, C, Asia 1, South African Territories (SAT) 1, 2 and 3. It is the causative agent 47 of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a highly contagious disease of cloven-hooved animals 48 affecting most notably cattle, pigs, sheep and goats in addition to wild species such as the 49 African buffalo. Disease outbreaks have serious economic implications resulting from trade 50 restrictions, reduced productivity and the slaughter of infected and at-risk animals (1). The 51 2001 outbreak in the UK caused economic losses of over \u00a38 billion to the tourism and 52 agricultural sectors. Inactivated virus vaccines are used in countries in which FMD is endemic, 53 but these are often strain-specific and provide little cross protection between serotypes (2). 54 Antigenic variation together with the relatively short duration of immunity following 55 vaccination combine to complicate control of the disease (3). In addition, the carrier state, in 56 which asymptomatically infected animals continue to shed virus, contributes to the spread of 57 FMDV (4). An improved understanding of the viral life cycle may be important for the 58 development of improved vaccines and other control measures. 59 60 The FMDV genome (approximately 8.4 kb) consists of a single open reading frame flanked by 61 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) (figure 1A) (5). The translated region encodes both 62 structural and non-structural proteins. The P1 region encodes the capsid structural proteins VP1, 63",

Of these five structural domains, functions have 76 been ascribed to only two, the cre and IRES. The cre region is involved in uridylation of the 77 RNA primer peptide, VPg (also known as 3B), and the IRES determines the initiation of 78 translation of the viral polyprotein (13, 14). The roles of the S-fragment, the poly-C tract and 79 the PKs in viral replication are not fully elucidated, however recent studies have shown that 80 truncations to the S-fragment can play key roles in the innate immune response to viral 81 infection (15-17). It has also recently been reported that viruses containing a deletion within 82 the pseudoknot region showed an attenuated phenotype in bovine cell lines while remaining 83 unchanged in porcine, suggesting a role for the pseudoknots in viral tropism (18).",
