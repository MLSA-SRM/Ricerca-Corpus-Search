A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published, in scientific journals as well as through non-peer reviewed channels, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination. We examined all full genome sequences currently available to assess the presence of sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies. Our analysis clearly shows severe limitations in the present data, in light of which any finding should be considered, at the very best, preliminary and hypothesis-generating. Hence the need for avoiding stigmatization based on partial information, and for continuing concerted efforts to increase number and quality of the sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic.",

Common symptoms of infection include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, while severe cases are characterized by advanced respiratory distress and pneumonia, often resulting in death 2 . Soon after the first epidemiological data together with SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences were made available, a glut of phylogeny-based analyses began to circulate discussing, in scientific papers as well as (social) media, countries that might have been fueling the spread. The implications of misunderstanding the real dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic are extremely dangerous. Ethnic or social discrimination resulting from unsupported assumptions on viral contagion -often amplified by irresponsible, uncontrollable communications -can be highly damaging for people and countries.",

Several discussions and evidence-based debates on controversial hypotheses on the epidemic have ensued -such as the number of untraced infections in the US, the putative virus introduction in Italy through Germany, and the alleged lineage diversification in China 4 later criticized 5 -aided by a concerted and productive effort of internationally-renowned research groups in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Oxford, UK, among others.

We downloaded all SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences deposited on GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) 8 to compare the number of high quality genomes sampled per country with the number of confirmed cases at the time of sampling, as well as the country's total population ( Figure 1 ). As March 10 th 2020, 331 genome sequences from 29 countries were available, almost twice as much than just one week earlier (March 3 rd 2020, 169 genome sequences from 22 countries). Yet, the sampling per country was inhomogeneous, with confirmed cases clearly uncorrelated to the number of genomes (Spearman correlation = 0.03). Moreover, correlation could only be investigated with confirmed cases (as proxy), since not all affected countries have made publicly available the total number of coronavirus testing performed. Even within the same country, sequenced genomes were usually sampled from few hotspots, not necessarily representative of the whole epidemic in that country.",

Quartets are considered \"resolved\" when the three likelihoods are significantly different (phylogenetic signal, most dots equally distributed in the corners, i.e. data are suitable for robust phylogeny inference), unresolved or partially resolved, when all three likelihood values or two of them are not significantly different (phylogenetic noise, most dots in sides or center areas, i.e. data may not be sufficient for robust phylogeny inference). Extensive simulation studies have shown that, for sequences to be considered robust in terms of phylogenetic signal, side/center areas of the likelihood mapping must include <40% of the unresolved quartets 12 , way lower than the 52.9% unresolved quartets detected in the SARS-CoV-2 full genomes alignment ( Figure 3b ). It is important to keep in mind that such a lack of phylogenetic signal makes the overall topology of any SARS-CoV-2 tree unreliable, and even clades with high bootstrap values should be interpreted with extreme caution. Finally, the mean genetic distance of each sequence from the root of a ML tree indicated that the available genomic data lack temporal signal (no significant linear correlation between accumulated genetic distance and sampling time, Figure 3c ). This is, again, expected in genomes obtained over a very short period of time (~ three months) since the beginning of the outbreak. Bayesian analysis 13 , which infers phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns from a posterior distribution of trees, might facilitate comparisons about different evolutionary scenarios, help in retrieving the correct topology, and estimate an accurate evolutionary rate. With more genome sequences sampled from different time points and geographic areas made available, literally, every day, Bayesian analysis may soon be a viable option. However, as long the new data do not increase phylogenetic and temporal signal, Bayesian phylogenetic and phylogeography results would remain equally questionable.",
