            "full_text": " Recent events highlight how emerging and re-emerging pathogens are actually becoming global challenges for public health. [1] Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses which are broadly distributed either in humans or in a vast majority of other mammals and birds. These viruses have the possibility to cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases. [2, 3] Coronaviruses are highly prevalent in many species. They have a large genetic diversity. Given their RNA, they are susceptible to frequent recombination and mutations of their genomes. In context in which there are increasing human-animal interactions, novel coronaviruses are very likely to emerge periodically. If the newly created cross-species pathogens acquires the ability to infect humans or to be transmitted human to human it can lead to occasional spillover events and epidemics. [4, 5, 6] In the past years two other strains of Coronavirus -severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -have emerged as potential public health worldwide threats. [5] SARS-CoV was the causal agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in 2002 and 2003 in Guangdong Province, China; [7, 8, 9] MERS-CoV was the pathogen responsible for severe respiratory disease outbreaks in 2012 in the Middle East. [10] On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology detected in Wuhan City, located in the Hubei Province, China, associated with exposures in a seafood and wet wholesale market in the same city. A new type of coronavirus was isolated on 7 January 2020. [11] On 30 January 2020 WHO declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). [12] This novel coronavirus suddenly turned out to be a global health concern for a disease, called Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), [13] which was characterized as a pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020. [14] Starting from the second-half of January 2020, scientific literature has been particularly focused on the description of this new viral outbreak; the main topics addressed were the epidemiological, clinical and virological aspects as well as the possible public health choices necessary to contain the spread of the disease. Nevertheless, several aspects are still unclear and have not been thoroughly explored, leaving grey areas in our knowledge of the disease and of the outbreak. The aim of this paper is to perform a bibliometric analysis on the first papers published in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, in order to give a glimpse to the researchers of \"who published what\" at the very beginning of this Public Health Emergency of International Concern. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database in order to find all relevant studies. After a preliminary search starting from 1 December 2019, we found out that the first article meeting our inclusion criteria was published on 14 January 2020. [15] [Supplementary materials, Table 1 , ID: 1] We subsequently extended our research to the first 30 days after this milestone article, up to 13 January 2020. We decided to scan the reference lists of the reviews retrieved in order to find potential additional pertinent articles, and to test string sensitivity. The search string used was: coronavirus* OR Pneumonia of Unknown Etiology OR COVID-19 OR nCoV. The virus name was updated from \"2019-nCoV\" to \"SARS-CoV-2\" by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February 2020, [16] yet we performed the search using the term \"nCoV\" since we presumed that no paper published between 11 February 2020 and 13 February 2020 would have used the term \"SARS-COV-2\". To achieve the highest sensitivity, we decided to use only a combination of keywords avoiding Mesh terms. Asterisks are used to truncate words, so that every ending after the asterisks was searched. We placed a language restriction for English, without other limits to the search. The papers were than classified on the basis of a standardized list of key information including: Digital Object Identifier number (DOI), title, journal name, day of first publication (online or paper form), country of the first author affiliation, article type, source of the data and topics addressed. The topics addressed were identified according to 8 categories: generic discussion, epidemiology, virology, pathology and clinical presentation, diagnosis, therapy, transmission, preparedness. Articles that addressed more than a topic in an extensive way were accounted for more than one of the 8 topic categories; the papers that could not be classified in any of the 8 chosen topic categories were classified in the \"Other\" topic category. Eight of us (FS, EA, EB, EB, FE, FM, FS, SS) independently screened all identified articles. Procedure was carried out through title and abstract scanning in order to verify the inclusion criteria. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus between the reviewers. If disagreement persisted, another reviewer (DG) was called as tie-breaker. The \"Number Needed to Read\" (NNR) is defined as the ratio of the number of retrieved abstracts to the number of the ones which are pertinent for the research purpose. [17] We calculated the NNR to identify the proportion of papers which were not editorials and commentaries, as well as the proportion of papers with directly collected data. Chi2 test was used in order to test for significant differences in the comparison of percentages, using the statistical software STATA 15 (StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical Software: Release 15. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC). A total of 442 papers were retrieved; 234 articles were found to be pertinent (see Figure 1 ) and read in extenso in order to define their main characteristics. The affiliation of the first authors was distributed among 36 countries: 36.3% of the papers (85 out of 234) had a first author with a Chinese affiliation, 18.4% and 13.7% (43 out of 234 and 32 out of 234) had a first author with an affiliation from UK and USA respectively, while first authors affiliation from Canada accounted for 3.8% of the total (9 out of 234), from Italy for 3% (7 out of 234), and from Australia and Korea both accounted for 2.1% (5 out of 234 each). All the other countries accounted for less than 2% of the first author affiliations (less than 5 out of 234). 63.7% of the papers (149 out of 234) were editorials, commentaries or letters (mainly reported data). 10.7% of the papers (25 out of 234) were secondary papers, mainly narrative reviews, which collected the knowledge available up to that point on some specific topics (i.e. genomics of the virus, transmissibility, etc.). The remaining 25.6% (60 out of 234) were original primary studies: among these, case reports accounted for 43.3% of the total, while in vitro or in vivo studies or genomic studies accounted for 21.7% of the total. The remaining primary studies were cohort studies, case control studies and surveys. Chinese first authors published more original data and primary studies than authors from the UK and the USA (32.9% vs 4.7% of the UK and 6.3% of the USA; p<0.001), who published mostly editorials and commentaries. Of note, 61.5% of the analysed papers used reported/non original data and 15.8% used official data. Conversely, only 17.5% of the papers used data which were directly collected on the field. In 5.2% of the papers the source of the data was not clearly specified. The supplementary materials (Table 1) , available online, report all the findings of this review with the reference and description of the 234 papers selected for the bibliometric analysis.

The second most frequent topic was \"Preparedness\" (23.1%): 83.3% of these papers consisted of commentaries, and only 1 paper was a primary study. The \"Epidemiology\" topic was addressed in 15.4% of the papers, and only 2 (5.6%) were primary studies. The lack of primary studies could be observed also for the \"Virology\" topic (14.1%) and the \"Transmission\" topic (12.8%), with only 12 (36.4%) and 6 (20%) papers reporting original data, respectively. On the other hand, the \"Pathology and clinical characteristics\" topic (12.8%) consisted mostly of primary studies (22, 73.3%). \"Therapy\" topic was addressed in 12% of the papers, with 9 papers (33.3%) being primary studies. The least addressed topic was \"Diagnosis\" (9.4%), with 12 papers (54.5%) reporting original data. Finally, 3% of the papers were classified in the \"Other\" topic category. Table 1 , ID: 218] assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection in specialised laboratories into the European Union/European Economic Area countries. This paper emphasized the need for countries to put in place strong measures in order to detect and laboratory-confirm cases early. It was also highlighted the need to perform molecular testing (RT-PCR, as also indicated by the WHO [19] ) on different specimens including: nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage, oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, sputum, (endo) tracheal aspirate and nasal wash. The communication report also underlined the need for a clinical validation of the test specificity and sensitivity. If nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are the recommended types of specimen for diagnostic testing an interesting brief report published by Chinese authors [20] [Supplementary materials 165, 167, 197, 222] were published in the second half of the time frame selected, mostly by authors with a Chinese affiliation. These papers addressed several aspects of COVID-19 treatment, such as interferon inhalation, use of and efficacy of antiviral drugs, potential repurposing treatments with angiotensin receptor blockers, use of antibiotics for bacterial co-infections, and respiratory support therapy (e.g. oxygen saturation, CPAP, invasive mechanical ventilation). Interestingly, one paper published on 4 February 2020 [21] [Supplementary materials, Table 1 , ID: 91] investigated the possibility that the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect lung cells might be ACE2, a cell-surface protein on lung AT2 alveolar epithelial cells; one of the known regulators of endocytosis for the AT2 cells is the AP2associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1). The authors suggested the possibility to use high-affinity AAK1-binding drugs to inhibit endocytosis of AT2 cells, such as baricitinib (an oral, targeted All rights reserved.

From the second half of January to the first half of February the proportion of editorials and commentaries changed the NNR from 3.6 to 2.6, meaning that we passed from a mean 3.6 papers to read in order to find an non-editorial/commentary to 2.6 papers. The mean chance to read papers with directly collected data increased, with the NNR passing from 6.5 in January to 5.4 in February. The novel coronavirus infection that emerged two months ago (as already discussed, the new coronavirus was isolated on 7 January 2020) places emphasis on the importance of ensuring that health professionals, researchers and the public have the best possible scientific information. Bibliometrics is a scientific method widely used in many fields for quantifying and analysing published information. [22] This kind of literature analysis in the first month after the first publication in Pubmed shows a great number of papers published as expected, mainly by authors with a Chinese affiliation, followed by authors with an UK or USA affiliation. The reason for this distribution is ascribed to the fact that China is the country where the virus was originally isolated and the first one with a COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, we have to point out that, as shown in a commentary published in Nature, in recent years China produced more science PhD than any other country in the world and the Chinese government has been assuming a leading role in supporting its own scientific research. [23] Therefore the research and publication response to the outbreak has been prompt and lively, giving to the scientific community many elements for understanding the new infection. The second country with the highest number of publications was the UK, followed by the USA, probably due to the fact they are the most prolific countries for scientific research. Authors from the UK and the USA wrote mostly editorials and commentaries. The publication policies of many of the most important scientific journals were adapted to quickly review and publish scientific papers on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. This strategy facilitated the spread of new knowledge on the new infection and on the outbreak. Hence, it is important to have scientific shared papers in order to reduce misinformation which is itself a public health threat. [24] In the early scientific literature we analysed there is a lack of primary studies with original data, as expected, given the very short period of time considered after the first pertinent publication on the new infection. Nevertheless, editorials, news and commentaries are important to share opinions and the viewpoint of an expert or a panel of experts, rather than on producing new scientific evidence. the variety and severity of the presentation of COVID-19. Further publication and reviews on this topic are needed to summarize the knowledge arising from all the case reports. Diagnostic tools, except for CT scan, were poorly represented and discussed, especially in terms of molecular diagnosis and standardization of the techniques. The \"Therapy\" topic was also poorly represented, since more time is needed for clinical intervention studies. Analyzing the selected time frame, the percentage of the editorials, news and commentaries has decreased. This was highlighted particularly by our analysis, which shows that from the second half of January to the first half of February the proportion of editorials and commentaries lowered the NNR, thus indicating an increase in the level of evidence produced as well as the increase of primary data availability. There are several limitations in our study. First, we based our research only on PubMed, that does not index all of the scientific impacted journals. It is strongly recommended to consult more than one relevant database when performing systematic reviews of the literature, [25] even though it has been reported that most of the high-quality articles, like those included in Cochrane Reviews, are indexed in PubMed. [26] In addition, we excluded all the publications not in English. We acknowledge that, given the outbreak started in China, this may have led to a partial selection bias. Nevertheless, papers excluded which were written in Chinese and had an English abstract, were for the greatest part reports of the Chinese Government (data not shown). We considered only the articles published until 13 February 2020, and taking into account that literature is now changing day-by-day for this topic, extending the bibliometric research for the next months would be of paramount importance. In conclusion, as far as we know, our very early review is the first bibliometric study analyzing the early scientific research output about COVID-19 from a quantitative and descriptive standpoint. Due to the huge amount of interest and concern related to this outbreak, our analysis shows that the scientific publication has been very reactive but still preliminar, with an expected deficit of original data and an excess of editorials and commentaries. Further research is needed to review and synthesize the growing knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, with a special aim on the most important knowledge gaps in terms of diagnosis and effective preventive and therapeutic measures.

            "full_text": " In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and epidemiologically linked to a seafood wholesale market [1, 2] . It has been determined that the pathogen causing the viral pneumonia among affected individuals is a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1, 3] . The pathogen exhibits high human-to-human transmissibility and has spread rapidly within and beyond Wuhan city [4, 5] . On January 30 th , 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [6] . Wuhan is central China's transportation hub with a population of 11 million residents and a large number of higher-education students (~1.3 million in 89 universities and colleges), a particularly mobile population [7] . Beyond these factors, viral spread was likely exacerbated further by the surge in domestic and international travel during the 40-day Lunar New Year (LNY) celebrations (from January 10 th , 2020 to February 18 th , 2020) -the largest annual human migration in the world, comprised of hundreds of millions of people travelling across the country. As of February 4 th , 2020, China has reported 20,530 confirmed cases and 23,314 suspected cases with 2019-nCoV infections [8] . Of the confirmed cases, 2788 are severe and 426 people have died. Most cases were reported from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province, and all provinces have confirmed cases imported from Wuhan and secondary transmission has been reported in some provinces. Additionally, there were 153 cases reported in 23 countries outside of China, with most having a travel history involving Wuhan [6] . The potential pathway from this local outbreak in Wuhan to a pandemic might involve four steps: i) local transmission in Wuhan (primary city of epidemic); ii) spread from Wuhan to other cities within and beyond China via infected travellers, causing sporadic secondary transmission in these cities (secondary city of epidemic), iii) further spreading from secondary cities with local transmission to other tertiary cities in China and international cities via returning travellers after the LNY holiday; iv) onward transmission across multiple countries and leading to a pandemic. To interrupt the spread, a cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and surrounding cities in Hubei Province has been in place since January 23 rd , 2020, just two days before the LNY's Day. However, significant numbers of people had likely already travelled back to their hometowns for the holiday by this time. According to Wuhan authorities, it is .

Here we conducted a travel network-based analysis to explore patterns of domestic and international population movements from high-risk cities in China, and provide preliminary estimates of the potential risk of 2019-nCoV spreading across and beyond the country. Given the current epidemic and limited understanding of the epidemiology of this disease, our findings on travel patterns from historical data can help contribute to tailoring public health interventions. To identify the areas that are most vulnerable to virus importation, we performed and integrated a series of analyses, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone-based population movement data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports. We defined the potential risk and geographic range of 2019-nCoV virus spread across three scenarios: 1) from the primary city (Wuhan) into other cities in mainland China (31 provincial regions), 2) from high-risk secondary cities into other cities across China, and 3) from high-risk cities in mainland China into cities in other countries or regions during the LNY holiday and the following three months. We also estimated the number of airline travellers likely needing to be quarantined or screened to capture travellers potentially exposed to 2019-nCoV in high-risk cities of mainland China. To define daily patterns and the connectivity of population movements at county and prefecture (city) level across mainland China during the LNY holiday and the following three months, we used the aggregated and de-identified daily flow of the users of Baidu, the largest Chinese search engine [10] . Baidu offers location-based service (LBS), based on the global positioning system (GPS), IP address, location of signalling towers and WIFI, for online searching, mapping, and a large variety of apps and software for mobile devices. These data have been used to visualize population migration around Chinese New Year [10] . Two Baidu datasets were used in this study. The first one covers daily movement data at county level from December 1 st , 2013 to April 30 th , 2014, as described elsewhere [11] . We calculated relative .

Relative netflow = (inflow -outflow) / population of each county The second dataset is a more recent daily movement matrix at the city level based on data from Baidu's search app from January 1 st , 2015 to April 30 th , 2015. The last recorded locations of a user (or device) for each day were compared, and if the location changed, then we counted the user (or device) as someone who had moved from one city to another city. To understand the spread risk of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan into other cities via domestic population movement, we aggregated daily outflows of people from Wuhan to other cities across mainland China for the two weeks (the quarantine period of the virus) prior to the cordon sanitaire of Wuhan. As the travel ban took place on January 23 rd , 2020, just 2 days before LNY's day, and given that LNY's day in 2015 was February 19 th , we took February 17 th , 2015 as a reference of the lockdown day in our dataset. Using the second dataset, then the risk of importation for each destination city or province was preliminarily defined as the percentage of travellers received by each city or province out of the total volume of travellers leaving Wuhan during the two weeks before the city's lockdown. These secondary cities may have a high risk of community-level transmission through the introduction of infected travellers from Wuhan, and then spread the virus to other tertiary cities by returning population movements after the LNY holiday, causing an even wider spread of the virus. As most of the cities in Hubei province have implemented the same travel controls as Wuhan before LNY, we defined the high-risk secondary cities outside of Hubei province as the cities within top 30 ranked cities (Supplementary Table S1 ) with the highest risk of importation from Wuhan defined above. Based on the 2015 Baidu dataset on population movement, the risk of spreading the virus from high-risk secondary cities to tertiary cities was preliminarily calculated as the averaged percentage of travellers received by each tertiary city out of the total volume of travellers leaving each high-risk secondary city during the four weeks following LNY's Day. We chose a period of four weeks because the returning flow of LNY's population movement, Chunyun, generally lasts four weeks. .

IATA data accounts for approximately 90% of passenger travel itineraries on commercial flights, and these data represent direct origin (Wuhan) to destination trips, and indirect trips that originated in Wuhan, but had connecting flights to a final destination. We quantified monthly volumes of airline travellers departing Wuhan and high-risk secondary cities from February 1 st , 2018, through April 30 th , 2018. With the assumption that the population movements around the LNY holiday in 2020 was consistent with the pattern in 2018, all final destinations were ranked by volumes of airline travellers, and the relative risk of importation was defined as the percentage of airline travellers received by each destination city out of the total volume of travellers leaving high-risk cities in China. We also estimated the number of airline travellers that may have needed to be kept in quarantine from Wuhan during the two weeks prior to the city's travel ban. The LNY's day in 2018 was on February 16 and the lockdown of Wuhan happened two days before LNY's day, corresponding to the date of February 14 th , 2018. We therefore defined the number of travellers needing to be quarantined as half of the volume of airline travellers from Wuhan in February, 2018, representing the 2-week total number of travellers for the first half of February. We then estimated the number of infections and its 95% uncertainty interval (UI) in these airline travellers from Wuhan, based on a binomial distribution and the proportion of 2019-nCoV infections in the citizens evacuated from Wuhan reported by Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Germany, as of January 31 st , 2020 [6, [14] [15] [16] [17] . Additionally, to capture travellers potentially exposed to virus, we also estimated the volume of airline travellers that would be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April. Considering air traffic flows from China have changed due to the airline flight cancellations, travel restrictions imposed by countries or regions, or changes in travel behaviours, we calculated the volume of travellers using different scenarios of reductions (50%, 75%, and 90%) in total passenger volumes. .

Additionally, we also compared the spatial patterns of the risks of Chinese cities importing the virus from Wuhan, estimated by the population movement data in 2014 and 2015, and more recent data on the top 50 ranked origin and destination cities in January 2020, available from the Baidu Migration site (https://qianxi.baidu.com/). To futher validate our results, we also compared the importation risk estimated in this study with the number of reported imported cases from Wuhan to other provinces in mainland China, as of January 25 th , 2020, and the number of imported cases reported by other countries or regions, as of February 3 rd , 2020 [6] . The distribution between days of travelling from Wuhan, illness onset, first medical visit, and hospitalization of imported cases, as of January 25 th , 2020, were also analysed. These case data were collated from the websites of WHO, national and local health authorities or new agencies within and beyond China (Supplementary Note). R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to perform data analyses. Significant migratory flows occurred in opposite directions before and after LNY's Day. In Wuhan City, mass movements of people began about three weeks prior to LNY, with the first peak of population leaving the city before the start of the winter holiday for universities, especially in the three counties that contain many universities and students (Figure 1 ). Although a cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and some cities in Hubei Province has been in place since January 23 rd , 2020, the timing of this may have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan, as another peak of movements out of the city was seen 2 days before LNY's day.

Other cities in Hubei Province received huge amounts of people during the two weeks before LNY and showed a decreasing population since LNY, following a peak of outflow at the end of the LNY holiday (Figure 1b and Supplementary Table S2 ). If Wuhan's lockdown had not have been undertaken, our analyses suggest the main destination cities of population outflow since LNY would have been similar to the situation two weeks prior to LNY (Supplementary Table S3 ). In terms of the initial importation risk of virus for each city during the two weeks before Wuhan's lockdown, nearly all other cities in Hubei Province were estimated to be high-risk areas (Figure 2a ). Other places with high risks were Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other large cities. In terms of the provincial level, the risks were high in Guangdong and Hunan, followed by Henan and Zhejiang (Figure 2b ). There was a significant correlation (r-squared = 0.59, p < 0.001) between the number of imported cases and the risk of importation estimated from traveller numbers from Wuhan within the two weeks before LNY's Day (Figure 3a ). Further, a high proportion of cases travelled with symptoms at the early stage of the outbreak, and the lag from illness onset to hospitalization decreased from a median of 6 days (Interquartile range: 4-7 days) in the first half of January 2020 to 3 days (1-5 days) in the second half ( Figure 4 ). According to our definition outlined in the methods, the 17 high-risk secondary cities outside of Hubei Province were identified as: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Changsha, Xi'an, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Nanchang, Chengdu, Hefei, Fuzhou, and Dongguan ( Figure 5) . Should community-level outbreaks occur in these cities, they could contribute to further spread of infection to other highly connected cities within China via movement after the holiday (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 ). Based on historical air travel data, the connectivity and spread risk between high-risk cities in mainland China and cities in other countries or regions was defined for the three months around the LNY holiday (Supplementary Figure S3 and Tables S4 and S5). Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Taipei ranked in the top three, followed by Seoul, Tokyo and Singapore. The main destinations were presented by region in the supplemental materials (Supplementary Figures S3-S9 and Table S4 -S7). During the two weeks before Wuhan's lockdown, there were an estimated total 59,912 airline .

Thailand, Japan, and Taiwan ranked in the top three, followed by Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Based on an overall infection rate of 1.39% (16/1149; 95% UI: 0.80% -2.25%) in citizens evacuated from Wuhan before Table S8 ). As of February 3 rd , 2020, a significant correlation (r-squared = 0.58, p < 0.001) was seen between the number of imported cases reported in those countries or regions and the risk of importation via travellers defined in our study (Figure 3b ). Because significant intranational and international spread from Wuhan has already occurred, a very large number of airline travellers (6.5 million under the scenario of 50% travel reduction as usual, 3.3 million under 75% reduction, and 1.3 million under 90% reduction, respectively) would be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China ( Figure 5 ) and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 (Table 1 and  Supplementary Tables S9 and S10) , to ensure that all travellers from high risk cities were covered. Addtionally, based on monthly air passenger travel statistics and time series of public and school holidays in 91 countries from 2010 to 2018 (Supplementary Note), we found the seasonal pattens of domestic and international population movements across years were highly consistent with the timing and duration of public and school holidays in different countries (Supplementary Figure S10 and S11) . Moreover, we also found similar spatial patterns in the risks of Chinese cities importing the virus from Wuhan via population movements estimated by both the Baidu data in 2014 and 2015, and the more recent data covering the top 50 ranked destinations in 2020, (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S12) , highlighting the value of using historical data to rapidly assess present day risks.

Given the rapidly growing number of confirmed 2019-nCoV infections, increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission within and beyond China [4, 24] , and our limited understanding of this novel virus [25, 26] , the findings here from travel patterns in historical data and spread risk estimation can help guide public health preparedness and intervention design across the world [27] . In terms of domestic connectivity and risk, the high population outflows from three counties in Wuhan with many colleges and universities in the first two weeks of January were likely college students leaving the city to avoid the peak traffic just one week before the New Year. Because of the early timing of this movement, many students might have avoided the period when the virus spread rapidly in Wuhan, and their risk of spreading the virus may be low as well. However, our results suggest that during the two weeks prior to Wuhan's travel ban, a large number of travellers still departed Wuhan into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China and may have spread the virus to new areas, as the timing of the lockdown occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan. Further exacerbating this risk, we found that during the outbreak's initial stages, a particularly high proportion of cases travelled with illness caused by the virus, together with the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV through asymptomatic contacts, potentially causing additional transmission during travel [28] . Moreover, several destination cities ( Figure 5 ) outside of Hubei Province that received high volume of travellers from Wuhan prior to LNY's day may serve as significant secondary cities in the outbreak. Most of these cities have large populations and international airports, highly connected with other regions within and beyond China. The initial imported seed cases likely caused the local community transmission, and further spread the virus into wider geographical ranges following the population flows occurring due to the LNY holiday [19] . Therefore, substantial public health interventions have been immediately applied across the country since LNY, including the cordon sanitaire in several of the most affected cities, cancellation of mass gatherings, reduction of travel and contact rate, as well as the extension of the LNY and school winter holiday, which might mitigate subsequent local establishment of 2019-nCoV introduced by travellers. Beyond the cases that have occurred in China, air passengers have spread 2019-nCoV across countries and continents within a short time period [28, 29] . In particular, a high volume of international airline travellers left .

Substantial preparedness efforts at destination cities should be taken to prevent further international seeding and transmission, otherwise the local establishment of epidemics, and even a pandemic, might become inevitable. For example, exit and entry screening may be futher extended to capture travellers with fever who have potentially been exposed to the virus in high-risk Chinese cities where local transmission has been established. However, we estimated that a huge volume of airline travellers would be required to be screened in February to April, even under the scenario of significant reduction (90%) in air passengers compared with the same period of previous years. Therefore, ensuring that surveillance and health systems around the world are ready and sufficiently strong to detect and deal with cases seen is a priority. It is expected that further international exportation of cases from China will occur and cases may appear in any country [30] . Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of the 2019-nCoV infection [6, 31] . Of additional concern is that the anticipated destinations of hundreds of thousands of travellers departing China are to low-income or lower-middle income countries, where inadequately resourced medical and public health systems might be unable to detect and adequately manage an imported case of 2019n-CoV, including possible subsequent community spread. Due to current limited knowledge of the epidemiology of the virus at the time of writing (e.g. the proportion and infectiousness of asymptomatic or subclinical infections) and the rapidly changing situation of the outbreak, the simplicity of our approach to define importation risk can help to quickly update risk assessments, prioritise surveillance, target limited resources and understand the potential of 2019n-CoV introduction at specific destinations [32] . Compared with other studies [33, 34] , we explored the various scenarios of travel restriction and used a more comprehensive and spatio-temporally detailed population movement matrix, together with details on the actual final destination cities of air passengers based on the global itinerary dataset. These novel datasets provide new insights on the impacts of internal and international connectivity on potential transmission of this emerging pathogen during the LNY holiday and over the next three months. Nevertheless, it is important to note that our study has several major limitations. Firstly, while we do present simple scenarios of reduced air travel volumes, our primary analyses assume \"business as usual\" travel based on .

Second, the mobile phone data used may provide an incomplete and biased picture of travellers, as the data only cover the population owning a smart phone and using Baidu apps. Third, the case data used in this study likely varies in quality and completeness due to the timeliness of reporting, varying laboratory diagnosis capacities, and differences in details announced on health authority websites. Fourth, compared with airline travellers leaving Wuhan prior to January 23 rd evacuees from Wuhan during the January 29 th -31 st period might have a higher risk of infection due to their longer stay in Wuhan during the potential continued spread of the virus since January 23 rd . This may result in overestimates of the number of infections in airline travellers from Wuhan prior to the city's lockdown. Based on more recent population movement and epidemiological data, we aim to conduct more sophisticated modelling approaches to assess the effectiveness of control measures in China, the impact of movements of people returning from LNY holiday, as well as the risks of a 2019-nCoV global pandemic. .

After triggering functional changes in ACE2/AT2R, an imbalance in the steady-state cytokine regulatory axis involving the Renin-Angiotensin System and IP-10 leads to a cytokine storm.",
            "full_text": " The sudden outbreak of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of December 2019 poses a huge threat to human health worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes severe respiratory disease that can quickly spread from person to person and in some cases lead to death. Researchers have found that the new SARS-CoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses invade human cells in target tissues in a similar manner via high-affinity binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [1] . In recent epidemiological investigations of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and a preliminary study of the clinical characteristics of this disease [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , researchers have found that patients infected with the new coronavirus have severe symptoms similar to those of the SARS infection. The first batch of clinical data reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in China revealed \"cytokine storms\" in critically ill patients [7, 8] . However, the mechanism of the viral infection and pathological changes in the immune system is still lacking. The sooner this information is added to the current clinical knowledge of these viruses, the better the control and treatment of this disease. Here, we present an automated topic-wise inference method called TWIRLS (Topic-wise inference engine of massive biomedical literatures) for processing the massive biomedical literature to summarize coronavirus host-related entities. TWIRLS is capable of collecting, classifying, and analyzing reported coronavirus studies to reveal these entities based on the distribution of specific genes in the text of the articles. By combining with general protein interaction data, links between certain functional cellular/physiological components can be inferred to fill the knowledge gaps on the probable mechanism of host pathological changes. eventually leads to acute lung injury in the host. Therefore, TWIRLS can be used to guide human researchers by providing further potential therapeutic target information for the treatment of acute viral lung injury based on the regulation of RAS. Coronavirus-study specific entities and host genes As of February 21, 2020, the PubMed database included 14,878 biomedical articles on coronaviruses. We obtained text data (called local samples) from all related articles on the coronavirus that had been peer reviewed and published by human experts, which included the title, abstracts, author and affiliation information (total 3,182,687 words). The goal of the literature mining was to identify host genes and entities that are relevant to coronavirus research and to establish connections between them. An entity can refers to a word or phrase of the concept name (including related concepts, e.g., virus structure and chemical composition, source of infection, and virus type). The gene names were defined using the mammalian official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Naming Committee (HGNC) database. We directly retrieved 667 candidate genes from the local samples. By establishing a random distribution of one of the candidate genes in a control sample, the significance of this gene appearing in the local samples can be determined when the frequency of the current gene is an outlier of the random distribution of the control samples (see Methods for details). By calculating the odds ratio, we can also further determine the specificity of the association between this gene and the local samples. In this paper, we selected an odds ratio > 6 as the threshold for this judgment, which resulted in 123 coronavirus study-specific host genes (CSHGs). To determine the specificity of the entity, we made a choice between different texts in the local samples. We removed numbers, symbols, verbs, and garbled characters to obtain clean versions of the local samples. The coronavirus study-specific entities (CSSE) were then identified in only the clean texts containing CSHGs. Based on the clean selected samples, we next built a local dictionary of candidate CSSEs containing 49,293 words after deduplication. Before calculating the random distribution of each entity, we included the synonymous entities into a same entity number (including singular or plural words, active and passive forms, different tenses, suffixes that do not change the meaning, etc.). For example, synonymous entities such as coronaviral, coronavirus, coronaviruses were grouped into one entity as coronavirus and assigned the same number (see entity number in Table S1 , Sheet 1 first column). The previous method of merging synonymous entities was based on a dictionary [9, 10] , which not only relied on the integrity of the dictionary, but also required a long retrieval time. To automatically solve the synonymous entity problem, TWIRLS classifies similar strings based on whether there is a significant statistical association between the character blocks in a set of candidate entities including various synonymous entities (see Methods). After cleaning and processing, CSSEs were identified by TWIRLS using a similar method to that for CSHG as described above. For the candidate CSSE dictionary, a random distribution model for each entity was built by TWIRLS using the control samples. We identified 623 CSSEs (Table Sl, Sheet 1) based on the outliers discriminated by the random model and calculated odds ratio. For example, TWIRLS found 100 CSSEs close to ACE2, the receptor of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 viruses (see left panel in Figure 1 ). The size of the entity represents the relative distance to ACE2, with a larger size indicating a closer distance to ACE2. Additionally, we present the CSSE cloud of the human receptor gene DPP4 of the MERS virus (see right panel in Figure 1 ). Although TWIRLS only identified 623 CSSEs after collation, for human researchers, the information is scattered in words, which is limited for reconstructing understandable mechanistic models. Therefore, TWIRLS clusters CSSEs according to the rules defined by CSHG distribution, as genetic level research can accurately answer and solve physiological and pathological problems. TWIRLS first calculated the specific co-distribution between CSHGs in local samples, then determined the distance between each pair of CSSEs and performs dichotomy clustering according to the linkage relationship between CSSEs and CSHGs. This classified the 623 entities into 32 categories represented as C0-C31 (see category number in Table S1 , Sheet 1 second column). In addition, for each category, TWIRLS also cited the top ten most relevant references for human researchers (Table S2) . Therefore, in any category, according to the CSSE and the most relevant literature, we can quickly provide \"Labels of conclusion-drawn-by-human-researcher\" (HR Labels) for this category. This label outlines the most relevant research directions of the current entity category. For example, for category C3, the HR label is \"Neurotrophic Coronavirus Related to Immune-Mediated Demyelination\". We have summarized the HR labels for the 32 entity categories in Table 1 . The relative position of any CSHG to a certain CSSE can be estimated by TWIRLS (see Table S1 , the ranking matrix in Sheet 1). As each category contains different entities, we can determine whether a certain CSHG is significantly closer to each entity in the current category based on the ranking matrix between CSHG and CSSE. For example, the average distance between ACE2 and the 92 entities in category C5 is first calculated, then a random distribution model of the average distance between ACE2 and any of the 92 entities (3000-5000 times) is built, and finally, we determine if the average distance between ACE2 and entities in category C5 is significantly less than and deviates from the mean of the random distribution (Z score = -5.8416). The significance of each category associated with each CSHG is then scored by TWIRLS ranging between -10 and +10, with a smaller score indicating the current CSHG is more relevant to the current category (see the Z-score matrix in Table S1 , sheet 2). For an entity category, the associated CSHGs (e.g., Ci CSHGs, where i represents the category number) can thus be selected by a Z score <-3 (the Z scores describing the association between CSHG and any category is summarized in Sheet2 of Table S1 , and the category labels of all CSHGs are provided in Sheet 3). Specifically, Spike proteins (S proteins) of different coronaviruses recognize different receptor molecules on human cells, such as ACE2 (binds to Spike proteins in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 virus) and DPP4 (binds to Spike protein in MERS virus). We found that these two genes are assigned to the C5 category, which has a corresponding HR label of \"Spike protein (S) of coronavirus\", suggesting that TWIRLS can automatically provide an interface to summarize human findings and help human experts quickly understand the research directions and necessary knowledge in this field. The distribution and meaning of the data can be compared to specific expression values of CSHG under different conditions (here, the category is used as a condition).

On the other hand, TWIRLS can also recommend the most likely and least likely categories for each signaling pathway. As an example, Table 3 shows the signaling pathways most likely associated with category C3 with the most unlikely corresponding category. We coupled the data with gene interaction/regulation databases and constructed a generalized protein-protein interaction network (PPI network) among 119 genes out of the 123 CSHGs. We defined the direct interaction between two genes as a 1 degree (1 o ) interaction, and the indirect interaction connecting two genes through a gene as a 2 degree (2 o ) interaction. All the genes in the 1 o networks mined in the PPI database are shown in Figure 2 . The results after deduplication showed 2,004 pairs in the 119 CSHGs (see Table S1 , Sheet 4). As a control, the average interactions of 119 randomly selected genes in the database showed between 252 to 612 pairs (average 220.16, standard deviation 35.15). Compared to random genes, the regulatory connections between CSHGs were significantly enriched (Z score = 50.97). Those CSHGs associated with a certain category had much closer interactions. For example, CSHGs associated with category C3 (or associated with C5 or C10) were closer to each other in the 1 o networks (Figure 2 ), suggesting that TWIRLS can possibly highlight important research directions and biology systems involved in coronavirus-specific research and can provide reliable interfaces for further automatic inference. Several hub genes among the 119 CSHGs were further recommended by TWIRLS. Compared to a random sampling from all interactions recorded in the database, these hub genes had significantly increased numbers of interactions with the other 118 CSHGs. The recommended results showed that the three members of the IFITMs family (IFITM1-3) ranked first, second, and sixth among the top ten hub genes (CSSE cloud of the IFITMs family genes is shown in Figure 3 ; detailed ranking recommendation results are shown in Table S1 , Sheet 5). These IFITMs genes showed 115 interactions, accounting for 8.59% out of all 1,338 interactions of the 119 CSHGs. These IFITMs were significantly enriched in the local samples representing updated coronavirus-related All rights reserved.

The IFITMs family plays crucial roles in the induction of interferons during viral infections. Under the action of interferon, IFITMs disrupts intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and prevents the virus from entering the host cell [11] . However, TWIRLS did not directly associate IFITMs with any category, so we needed to provide more information so that TWIRLS can determine which part of these genes might be involved in the coronavirus infection and host body response. Combining with generalized interaction databases provides richer interactions and regulatory linkages. We extended the 119 CSHGs to their 2 o networks based on the interactions with higher likelihood of connections (Combined score> 800). The 2 o networks expanded the number of genes from 119 host genes to 3,494 genes that may be associated with coronavirus (see Table S1 , Sheet 6 with DPP4 [12] . The different distribution of these receptors in the respiratory tract results in different degrees of infection. Although the infection ability of MERS is lower than in SARS, the mortality is higher (in about one-third of patients) because of the deeper infection site [13] . Similar to the SARS virus, viral genomics and structural biology studies have shown that ACE2 is also a functional receptor for the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. After binding to ACE2 via its Spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes membrane fusion and enters the host cells by endocytosis. The ACE2 peptidase is a key regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS). It is highly expressed in the heart, kidney, and testis, and is also expressed at lower levels in other tissues (mainly in the intestine and lungs) [14, 15] . Recent studies have shown that the binding of the S protein to ACE2 in the new coronavirus is 10 to 20 times stronger than in the SARS virus [16] , which may help the new coronavirus infect the host through the upper respiratory tract, significantly increasing its infectivity. Using TWIRLS, we were able to identify both ACE2 and DPP4 genes as CSHGs, and both were significantly associated with the C5 category. The HR label for this category is \"associated with S protein.\" In addition to ACE2 and DPP4, other CSHGs that are significantly associated with the C5 category include FURIN and TMPRSS2. The former may be required for the H7N1 and H5N1 influenza virus infections, probably via hemagglutinin-induced lysis, whereas the latter is widely reported to mediate and assist in the invasion of host cells by multiple viruses. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a serine protease that hydrolyzes and activates the spike glycoproteins of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC), Sendai virus (SeV) and human interstitial pneumovirus (HMPV), and 1,2,3 fusion glycoproteins of F0, 4a, and 4b human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) [17, 18] . The function of this gene is essential for the transmission and pathogenesis of influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2 and H7N9 strains). It is also involved in the hydrolysis and activation of hemagglutinin proteins, which are essential for viral infectivity [19, 20] . Although entities in the C5 category and in the cited literature mainly show that virus invasion is facilitated by virus-binding receptors and membrane proteases, the biological mechanism of the receptor binding to viruses leading to pathological changes has been reported less frequently.

These inferences are based on a process that finds new genes connected to different categories. The connected categories suggested potential regulatory relationships between different biological functions or phenotypes. The genes that serve as linkers are potential targets for gain-and loss-of-function experiments to identify those systems described by the meaningful entities in these categories. In this paper, TWIRLS found the 2 o networks showed connections with certain CSHGs associated with categories or with no category. For example, TWIRLS found that CSHGs in the 2 o connections of IFITM1 were mainly concentrated in the C3 category (see Figure 4 ). Interestingly, CSHGs in the 2 o connections of ACE2 and DPP4 associated with C5 category were also enriched in C3 category, inferring that the information summarized in C3 category probably describe the underlying mechanisms of the pathological changes after coronavirus infection. In our analysis, the signaling pathways in C3 were mainly RAS, Vitamin D and RXR activation, and Chemokine signaling, with RAS being the most significant (as shown in Table 3 , which summarizes C3-related signaling pathways). which then linked to C3-associated cytokines including CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCR2, and CXCR3 ( Figure 5 ). Subsequently, these linker genes may contain information on the biological mechanisms that may be important for understanding the disease. For example, TWIRLS recommended angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2 or AT2R) genes in the C3 category associated with ACE2. This supports that RAS is probably involved in the pathological changes caused by cytokine storms after S protein binds to ACE2, as suggested by other reports. We next used TWIRLS to calculate the 1 o and 2 o networks of all 119 CSHGs. Based on the significantly enriched categories of CSHGs in the above networks, TWIRLS separately constructed models for the complex relationships of each CSHG. We found that 45.53% of the All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This suggests that the biological mechanisms described by the C3 and C10 categories might be universally involved. Research on the entities, genes, pathways, and linker genes participating in the C3 and C10 categories could lead to new directions for the prevention, treatment, and clinical management of coronavirus infections. In this study, we used TWIRLS, a machine-based approach to collect, summarize, and analyze about 15,000 biomedical articles related to coronavirus, with the aim to elucidate the mechanisms underlying coronavirus-induced host pathological changes. Using TWIRLS, we found a possible mechanism involving ACE2/AT2R-RAS-Cytokine signaling, which becomes imbalanced under virus infection leading to cytokine storms. The TWIRLS system is an automated process that can summarize the entities and genes specifically related to coronaviruses. By combining this system with generalized interaction databases, we can reveal further associations that can provide a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms of the disease phenotype caused by virus-host interactions. virus to ACE2 may disrupt this balance, which causes a steady-state imbalance of RAS, leading to subsequent pathological changes. Although Ang II was originally described as an effective vasoconstrictor, there is growing evidence that it is closely involved in the inflammatory response of the immune system. Pro-inflammatory cytokines derived from immune cells normally regulate the RAS component, which further accelerates the formation of systemic and local Ang II [28] [29] [30] . In particular, pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate the production of AGT in the liver and kidney [31] [32] [33] . On the other hand, RAS has also been implicated in mediating the cytokine storm and has functional relationships with the immune system. Angiotensin II regulates vascular tension and stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [34, 35] . The production and release of CXC chemokines can induce the accumulation of neutrophils in vivo [36] . Meanwhile, ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers have been used in a number of cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathologies, and AT1R blockers (angiotensin receptor blocker) were shown to have beneficial effects that were commonly attributed to AT2R activation [37] . At the same time, it was reported that Ang II-stimulated human endothelial cells had increased release of a CXC chemokine, IP-10. The IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10 or CXCL10) is mainly expressed in the lung and is a chemoattractant for activated T cells. The expression of IP-10 has been observed in many Th1-type inflammatory diseases, where it is thought to play an important role in recruiting activated T cells to sites of tissue inflammation. Therefore, RAS dysfunction may result in the accumulation of cytokines, such as in the lungs leading to excessive accumulation of immune cells and interstitial fluid, blocking the airways and causing eventual death. As reported in the first severely infected patients diagnosed with COVID-19, a large number of patients experienced \"cytokine storms\" that was fatal [7] . Figure 6 summarizes the functional changes and pathological consequences of RAS system after ACE2 combines with the coronavirus. We expect the mechanism summarized and reasoned by TWIRLS can be further supported by pathological evidence. To date, only one report of a post-mortem biopsy has been published with pathological data. Although histological examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, the right lung showed evidence of desquamation of All rights reserved.

The schematic representation of the overall study design is shown in Figure 1 and can be summarized in the following steps. The dataset used in this pipeline were from PubMed articles. First, PubMed was searched for articles including titles, abstracts, author and affiliation information containing the subject keyword \"coronavirus\". The search results were downloaded in txt format for compiling into structured information. The text in the subject abstract set was organized and cleaned, and then assigned to specific corpuses related to coronavirus (specific corpus) and compiled into the subject dictionary. To enhance the accuracy of the effective entities associated with the keyword, we used a random corpus for comparisons. We searched for article abstracts containing the keyword \"public health\" and compiled the abstract set into a random corpus, and then compiled them into a randomized control dictionary, which contains a wide range of proteins, genes, and related biological entities. We also considered a balanced amount of information by setting relevant parameters to adjust the amount of text before carrying out the statistical analyses. Biological entity identification is a key step in the literature mining process [7, 8] . To ensure functionality of the extracted entity, we first compared the entity from the subject dictionary with the human official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Nomenclature Commission (HGNC) database [9] to generate subject candidate genes using standard nomenclature. In addition, the entities in the abstract were capitalized to avoid errors in the identification process. To obtain widely used gene entities that are precisely related to the subject and to determine the significance of the gene distribution in the specific texts, we calculated the difference in the distribution proportions. We searched for the subject candidate genes in the subject dictionary and the randomized control dictionary, respectively. We also counted the number of abstracts containing each subject candidate gene in each abstract set, respectively. Finally, we calculated the odds ratio of each subject candidate gene and sorted them into a list of precisely related genes (CSHG). Similar to the process of identifying CSHG, we calculated whether entities were significantly distributed in a specific corpus. We counted the number of texts containing each CSHG in a specific corpus, and then counted the number of each candidate entity in the corpus subset. Next, we randomly selected the same amount of text from the random control corpus and then counted the number of each candidate entity in this subset of the random corpus. This was repeated 100-10000 times in the random corpus to generate candidate entities in the specified amount of text of the random distribution model. According to the central limit theorem (CLT), the distribution of random sampling averages of randomly distributed data always conforms to a normal distribution. Therefore, we can use the Z score to evaluate whether an entity is significant in a specific text. Here, we used a Z score cutoff value > 6. In addition, some entities have singular and plural noun forms, and synonyms with multiple forms in the abstracts. Therefore, we numbered the subject-related entity and automatically combined nouns with plural forms and homologous words with adjectives and adverb roots into the same entity, and then assigned them the same number.
